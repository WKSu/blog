    "text": "After spending time this year in Andalusia exploring the gorgeous mountains, learning about the historic period of Al-Andalus, and admiring beautiful architectural wonders it made me wonder what exactly it is I am looking for when I travel. I managed to get it down to my longing for the wilderness, to leave humankind behind me, and experience the incomprehensible that makes something great. Two articles have really helped me reflect and explore these thoughts: The Great Offline and The end of travel. For this post I will share my thoughts of travelling in Canada.\nAs a disclaimer, travelling is such a uniquely personal experience which people can shape and form to seek their love for the world. The previous articles linked feel like criticisms in the ways people travel. In a liberal society people’s norms and values come from their own search. This freedom is a curse and a blessing. It’s curse as it creates a certain emptiness where you have little to fall back on during life’s constant dilemmas. As these values are often tied to each other’s identity, they can become fanatical and polarising as we see in contemporary’s politics. In this post I try to explore these questions in our uncertain times for myself and only myself. However, the blessing is that this freedom allows us to do things differently, much faster than before. Ideas are able to exist and influence next to each other. It allows the person to figure out what they want. I want to acknowledge the many different ways of travel and this post merely tries to help me in shaping my way."

A term for when your mind can only think of the unsolvable, complex, international problems we face. Working tirelessly every day my mind was keen on distraction. There was no lack of options either: Netflix, Facebook, and YouTube all offered much-needed relaxation. Ultimately, YouTube was the more convincing offer. I would work in the Hague until 6 p.m., take the tram home and then, together with over 30 million others worldwide, watch YouTube videos to relax. After searching for “chess” and observing Magnus Carlsen pull off a wonderful win using the Sicilian defense, something peculiar happened.\nA video played, showing cheaters in the world of chess. After clicking back to a memorable game between Ajax and Real Madrid, YouTube took me towards videos on bribery. Outlandish claims became more present the further I went. The pattern continued as I searched for more topics, always leading me to more extremist videos on the topic I had initially searched for. Documentaries on the second world war led to holocaust denial videos, speeches by American presidents led to smear campaigns. YouTube’s autoplay function and the recommendation system drew my curiosity."

    "text": "The Influence of YouTube’s Recommendation Algorithm\nIt used to be that my friends would advise me what to watch, now YouTube seems to have replaced them. In return we do not need to spend any effort finding the next video that will get our minds of things. Using smart personalized suggestions, based on the enormous amount of data Alphabet Inc (owner of YouTube and Google services) owns, they know what makes you click. The recommender system keeps people interested and glued to the screen. The system recommends around 70% of the videos watched by users; the influence of YouTube is unavoidable. But why does this algorithm drive us to extremist content, with no intention from our side?\nTo answer that question, we need to inspect YouTube’s business model. As a platform, it brings together content creators and content viewers. YouTube makes money by brokering fitting advertisements to users. To optimize this process, their goal is to maximize the time spent on YouTube. This has not gone unnoticed by Reed Hastings, CEO of Netflix. During the earnings call he said: “Netflix’s biggest competitors are YouTube, Facebook, and sleep”. The attention economy views time as a scarce resource, if you spend time on one thing, it means a loss of time for something else. In the past, the market focused on getting money, nowadays, this fight is about time spent. More time on a platform means more advertisements, thus increasing YouTube’s share of the pie. This effect also takes place on YouTube itself, as they pay content creators proportional to the number of views they get on their videos, which again incentivizes to maximize the time spent by the users."

    "section": "Human Characteristics Exploited by YouTube",
    "text": "Human Characteristics Exploited by YouTube\nTo maximize this time, YouTube makes use of different human characteristics. First, people spend time on content out of the ordinary. Think of the number of movies or books about a regular person going to his regular job every day: The Godfather does not manage a supermarket, Batman and the Joker do not run a restaurant, and Frodo does not bring back a book to the library. Deep love dramas, heavy war stories, and extreme conspiracy theories attract people. This is no different when watching a YouTube video on the couch, where clickbait titles and extremist videos are just one click away.\nWhat makes things even worse is the human nature of curiosity. YouTube speaks to our core instincts by showing the tip of the iceberg, often in the shape of an interesting-looking clickbait title. Combined with the human skill of habituation YouTube’s influence increases. As with any addiction, for the first time only a small portion is enough, but as time passes, the portion has to increase more and more to keep us satisfied. Zeynep Tüfekçi, writer and academic on the social impact of technology, explained YouTube’s algorithm with the following example: a restaurant that continuously loads our plates up with sugary and fatty foods, in turn we keep wanting more. As time passes, the videos get more and more extremist.\nAnother human characteristic is the sheep-like behaviour of watching videos others have watched. This effect means the most extremist videos get watched and recommended repeatedly at an increasing speed. If all this was not enough, most of the views on extremist videos come from a small group of heavy users. This is like recommending a diet based on regular customers of a fast-food chain. Guillaume Chaslot, a former employee of YouTube, claimed the effect of sheep-like behaviour and heavy users increase extremists videos.\nSo part of the large availability of extremist content is inherent to the business model of YouTube. However, a second reason for the presence of extremist videos is the existence of ideological attackers. Ironically enough, YouTuber “Smarter every day”, showed a series of computer made videos, that somehow pierced through the defence mechanisms of the video platform. In combination with today’s ability to buy fake followers and subscribers to watch your videos, it is relatively easy to get your computer made extremist videos on the autoplay lists of over 30 million people every day.\nNot all parts of the recommendation are troublesome. Every day, people get recommended videos they love: new music videos, interesting chess games, highlights of a great football match. It is convenient and saves a lot of time, which is scarce in today’s society. However, are we aware of the price we pay for convenience? It is unclear how YouTube’s black box of recommendation works, despite having a huge impact on society. It is about time that the 30 million extremist content addicted people should rehabilitate."

    "section": "YouTube’s Role and Responsibility",
    "text": "YouTube’s Role and Responsibility\nIs YouTube responsible for our human nature to keep digging for more? Is it the viewers responsibility to understand that they are being influenced and prevent the effect? YouTube claims they are only a facilitating medium showing us the videos we want to see. There is a certain truth to that, of course we do not have to watch the recommended videos. We still have a choice. However, how informed is this choice? These corporations are driven by money to keep our attention on a platform. To do so, they have removed a big barrier: deciding what to watch. Imagine if you had to think yourself what to watch every night; indeed, you would be inclined to move on to something more convenient. In essence, corporations nowadays have fulfilled this decision of what we spent our time on for us. Though, looking at it that way, it is similar to voting for the national elections where someone has already filled in a choice for you, without explaining how they arrived at this conclusion. You could still erase that choice but convenience dictates that the majority will leave it there. Even though YouTube has “only” a facilitating role, their influence is significant to say the least. YouTube possesses the power to decide what users watch.\nUsers however, cannot get a grasp on what YouTube is actually doing to recommend videos. Since the introduction of their personalized recommendations with a deep neural network they have tweaked and changed the algorithm behind closed curtains. There is no way to know for certain what they actually did, as they will never reveal it voluntarily. It is in their best interest to find the ‘best’ algorithm to keep viewers attracted to their platform, in order to outrun competition. However, when the curtain gets lifted, it does not look good. In an interview with Bloomberg, it is stated that many engineers at YouTube claimed that the leaders were not interested in removing extremist videos or conspiracies. Yonatan Zunger, privacy engineer at the time of the introduction of the neural network algorithm, mentioned that he had a solution in place for videos close to breaching the community guidelines, allow them on the platform but do not recommend them, which was promptly rejected. Leadership only had one goal, which was getting more engagement from users: don’t rock the boat.\nThe adjustments that YouTube did reveal under the pressure of the media are a disappointment.\nThe survivors of the Parkland shooting event of 2018, where tragically seventeen people died, were met with online harassment. Conspiracy theories claiming that the event was not real were trending on social media, including YouTube. The YouTube recommender system kept promoting these conspiracy videos to the top. As these videos were often the first videos users would see when searching for the shooting, it shaped the minds of many people.\nThe danger lies in the ease of how a wrong message gets spread without the proper authority or sources to back the claims in this message. To combat this example of actively sharing wrong information, YouTube publicly announced they would add information from Wikimedia to inform people watching conspiracy videos. Worryingly, this only changes the narrative of YouTube’s responsibility. Instead of making sure that these harmful videos do not have a (active) place on their platform, they shift the burden to Wikipedia to make sure accurate information is placed. The head of Wikipedia’s public relations department, Katherine Maher, had some reservations. While Wikipedia is quite accurate, it relies on crowdsourcing and contributions of volunteers. According to Maher people need to be critical and check the sources which they simply ‘can’t do in a simple search result’, like in the case of the Parkland shooting.\nNot only Wikipedia articles will be included, but also ‘authoritative’ news will be included. YouTube then holds the power which news source will be published and deemed the authoritative source on the matter. The foundation of this algorithm also has significant flaws. The Washington Post revealed that the top news link for final election results led to a news site with false numbers. Attention to media bias has risen with polarized elections throughout the world. YouTube therefore now holds even more power by deciding which news articles to promote. The dangers of the recommender system do not only lie in extremist or conspiracy videos. Through recommendations a pedophile network was set up not long ago. These pedophiles would look at videos of children showing genitals, while the comments were full of time-stamps of these events. The algorithm did exactly what it was set out to do: find videos that kept this kind of users engaged. Driven by previous traffic these recommendations were fuelled by other pedophiles. A problem that YouTube has faced since 2017, still ongoing with no end in sight. When this controversy came up, prominent advertisers were very clear that they would pull out of YouTube if it was not fixed soon. YouTube’s solution? They removed accounts of the pedophiles, demonetized videos, and disabled the comment sections. This is YouTube playing whack-a-mole without changing structural incentives. YouTuber Matt Stone who highlighted these practices in 2019 in his video describes this as an ‘algorithmic wormhole’ that can be found in mere seconds.\nAnother mole that got whacked are the clickbait titles, with harmful content that got recommended often by YouTube’s algorithms. In their official blog, the YouTube team shared their solution of recommending based on likes and dislikes rather than the number of views, in order to reduce the presence of clickbait. However, remembering the opportunity to buy fake subscribers, which can like fake news videos computer-based, this change in the algorithms is not worth a penny.\nIn their latest update, the YouTube team mentions the reduction in recommendations of harmful videos, that come close to the line of the Community Guidelines, such as videos claiming the earth is flat, or false claims on historic events like 9/11 or the holocaust. However, YouTube is only working on reducing the presence of these videos in the recommendations overall. This means the videos will still be available on the platform, and can still be reached when users are on track towards those subjects. In fact, the only change that happens is the length of the road towards extremist videos. Keeping in mind the comparison to a restaurant where only sugary fat meals are served over and over again, this measure will not have any effect in the long run.\nWhat the stated examples have in common, is the symbolic nature. It seems that YouTube only takes symbolic measures to fix the noticeable symptoms, by doing just enough to spin the media narrative and to keep regulators happy, however, the company never touches the root cause of the problem."

    "section": "Proposed Scheme for Improvements",
    "text": "Proposed Scheme for Improvements\nAs YouTube operates in an electronic global environment that crosses borders, it is impossible to find a one-size-fits-all solution to the negative impact the recommender systems have on society. YouTube can be seen as a natural monopoly as a video platform, which means they hold all the power. Next to that, the many values involved, such as freedom of speech, democratic sovereignty and censorship, make it hard to keep all parties happy. So instead of searching for the policy that will fix the world, we propose a scheme of improvements to the system.\nThe first part of this scheme is to bring back old friends into the recommendation system in addition to YouTube’s recommendations. Making use of the friend system in YouTube, users can recommend videos to each other, which will be automatically added to the autoplaylist of the friends selected by the sharer. When all the videos recommended by a user’s friends are watched, the system returns to its current state of using YouTube’s recommended videos. As this function will be used more over time, the time spent on YouTube will exist for a bigger part of videos recommended by friends. A big impact this will make is the effect of social norms feeding into the recommendations.\nThe solution is, however, not perfect. Firstly, it is likely that there will be ‘influencers’ with an enormous amount of friends recommending videos. Secondly, it is very easy to get stuck in filter bubbles as well, only this time together with your friends. However, there is a shift of power from YouTube back to society. Whenever you get a video recommended you know it is from someone you are familiar with instead of a corporate entity. At the same time, the business model of YouTube does not have to change a single bit, but could even result in better user satisfaction.\nThe second part of the scheme incorporates society as a whole. Kevin Roose, a columnist for Business and a writer-at-large for The New York Times, talks of “deprogramming a generation” as a necessity to change the impact of platforms like YouTube. This part focuses on giving the people the tools to examine sources critically. YouTube is not just a place to find entertainment, but as was found by Pearson Education, over 50% of youngsters reaches out to YouTube as an information source. The platform should be seen as the library of the now. It is therefore important to inform the users which of the “books” can be seen as reliable, useful and trustworthy, just like it is taught in schools for books or internet websites. This collaborative effort between the government and YouTube should start in school but also on YouTube itself. This way the minds of the users will be changed, and harmful videos will be evaded. Specifically, an informative video could be created that explains how to interact with the different kinds of videos on YouTube.\nThe third and last part of our scheme that will shrink the negative impact of YouTube is to make the platform responsible for the videos they recommend. This would mean slightly pulling YouTube out of its facilitating role, causing them to be more involved with the content displayed on their platform. A legal framework should be created indicating the responsibility of YouTube and the changes the platform should make in order to recommend only the fruitful videos to users. This responsibility would at least remove the fake news videos that have been duplicated multiple times and viewed/liked by fake subscribers. If YouTube would be responsible for the videos they recommend, these types of fake, harming videos would not have a place in the auto playlists any longer. It is important to stress that this part of the scheme does not influence the freedom of speech value, as every legal video will stay available on the platform. No censorship takes place in what can be uploaded, recommendations will only become more thoughtful."

    "section": "Conclusion",
    "text": "Conclusion\nThe scheme sketched above can be seen as the way society started to deal with cigarettes not that long ago. Friends would not recommend cigarettes to each other, due to the social norms that exist. Of course smokers would recommend them, but this is inevitable. Likewise, extremist people are always going to find their way into extremist videos, and will recommend them to their friends as well. However, adding social norms to the system will decrease the overall use of the undesirable product. The education part of the scheme can also be seen in the use of cigarettes. Parents teach their children that smoking is bad, schools teach their students the same thing. By creating an appealing video that explains the dangers of extremist videos, but also shows how to interact with them, people will learn to evade such videos. Lastly, like society stopped the promotion of cigarettes, in the future the responsible YouTube will stop promoting (recommending) extremist videos completely. The scheme is a first step in regulating the influence of YouTube on our daily lives. When the walk is continued, YouTube will be a safe environment for relaxing distraction. It will not settle all the problems that YouTube’s algorithms inhabit, but at least we will be able to watch our daily chess videos peacefully."

    "text": "By going into nature, I am trying to get away from civilization and its problems. However, it is naive for me to think that these experiences have not been influenced by humankind. I acknowledge that these lands were inhabited by the indigenous people of Canada who were forcibly removed and their history on the lands erased. The areas I have visited are home to many diverse groups of Indigenous peoples who have shared their land under Treaty 6, 7, 8 and the treaties of British Columbia. I honour and acknowledge all of the First Nations, Métis and Inuit peoples who have lived, travelled and gathered on these lands for thousands of years. And still do. As a reminder I have tried to add the indigenous names to these wonderful places1. In another post I explore this complex story further.\n\n\nThe name “Canada” likely comes from the word “kanata,” meaning “village” or “settlement.” In 1535, two indigenous youths told French explorer Jacques Cartier about the route to kanata; they were actually referring to the village of Stadacona, the site of the present-day City of Québec.2\n\n\nMountains, wildlife, turqoise lakes, and beautiful crags is what I had been patiently waiting for since booking my tickets to Edmonton. I was getting more and more excited to head up to the world famous Canadian Rockies. Saturday the 16th of July is when we took a small Communauto packed with camping and climbing gear to go for a 13-day adventure totalling 2354 kilometres. Like a typical romcom cliche, it was love on first sight catching my first glimpse of the mountains from Hinton. Upon arrival it is clear why they are so renowned, you notice a certain wonder in the never-ending mountain chain. However, it is only when you get inside the mountain range that you understand its greatness. The Icefields Parkway from Jasper to Banff is a drive of a lifetime. We then continued west through Yoho National Park, Revelstoke, and Whistler taking Highway 99 to the world-class climbing area of Squamish. Finally ending up in Vancouver to go back to the Netherlands. In this post I will share my climbing experiences with you in these areas.\nEverywhere you look, there are these beautiful mountains towering over you. There is a certain greatness to them not only in their aesthetic beauty but also a sheer reminder of the forces of Nature. When entering the domain of the mountains, as you look at them, you can only feel small compared to these giants. Yet, there you are going through them one by one. They evoke the sublime, “of greater mysteries and potential beyond the typical”.\nMost of the climbing here was only possible because of my good friend Jason who hosted and guided me in these wonderful places!\n Gorgeous, gorgeous mountains"

    "text": "The climbing journey\nWhat is it that attracts people to bouldering & climbing? At first glance the allure seems obvious: the physicality, the rush of accomplishment, and the tight-knit community all play their part. What more do you need? Yet, one aspect often goes unnoticed when discussing its attraction: personal growth.\nAs you embark on the climbing journey, you won’t notice it at the beginning, but a seed is planted within you. It takes root and begins to grow, evolving from a mere seedling to a mighty tree through nurturing and practice. It is the mentality you bring to life. Climbing continually pushes you beyond your limits, challenges you at every turn, and forces you out of your comfort zone. It presents you with new obstacles to overcome and conquer. What is it, if not an analogy for life?\nIf you read this, you probably know me. I like to think, grow, and reflect. Let me give you a window into my world. This is a series of posts where I will reflect on my personal journey. Welcome to When you cannot stop.\n\n\nYou can do it\n\n\nOne of the best visual representations of exploring your limits and not stopping. It seemed impossible to climb the Dawn Wall but Caldwell and Jorgeson found a way.\n\nThis video remains etched in my memory. Watching this awe-inspiring feat makes my palms sweat and my body tense. How does one begin an endeavour everyone deems unattainable? What fuels the relentless attempts year after year, the refusal to surrender to defeat? For a long time, this fuelled my quest to explore my own limits in life. But today, I don’t wish to discuss the familiar you can do it mantra—akin to profit-driven companies assuring success upon purchase. I want to unveil the less discussed, the harmful side.\nHave you ever felt like a train hurtling along tracks, station to station? But then, you decide you want to be more than just the rhythm of the rails. You want to go faster. It’s that inkling, that curiosity to glimpse the next stop or the desire ignited by the journeys of other trains. Yet, as your speed increases, inevitability rushes in — some stations will be missed. And there’s an even subtler twist, the possibility of not even regretting those skipped stations. 🛤️🚂\n\n\nLively August\n\nThroughout the lively August 2022, my weekends were brimming with adventure. I finished the Rotterdam half-marathon. I went climbing in Berdorf, Freyr, and Pont-A-Lesse the following weekends after. Weekdays blurred into a medley of running, climbing, swimming, and, of course, work. I was hooked to the outdoor active lifestyle. At work, I had three amazing projects which I had to bring over the finish line still. This phase, the amazing feeling of conquering the summer run, the thrill of climbing, the joys of camping, and trying to contribute to my city came with a price. I was sprinting past my limits, carried away by my enthusiasm. All the achievements masked a subtle truth: I had done too much, too fast.\nLife thrives on contradictions; too much of a good thing can be bad for you. I had seen this cliché up close this summer. I went beyond my physical limits and as our bodies and minds are intertwined, it also influenced my mental space. Tiredness and the feeling of blankness started to creep in, simply said, I was running low on serotonin.\nThe solution seems simple, start doing less things. Take time for yourself and reset. However, this experience left me with more questions than answers, not that I had the energy to think about it. Why was following this advice so difficult? Why did I not see this coming? What was it that drove me to ignore my limits and its consequences?\n\n\nOld Pattern\nSeveral months later, my energy was restored. Reflecting on these questions revealed a recurring pattern. It encompassed not just climbing and work but also extended to games, movies, and studies—an endeavor’s pursuit to do things right. The pattern is usually as follows, when I do something, I want to do it right. And if you want to do it right, you have to spend a lot of time and energy on it. It is easy to label this as perfectionism, but I believe it is more about seeking depth and going beyond the surface level. Ranging from optimizing my Guardian build in Guild War 2 for the perfect setup, to in-depth analyses on the cinematography of movies, to spending my nights till 4am on reports.\nReturning to the present, as a trainee of the municipality, you get so much freedom to try to improve the city. The city I grew up in. And climbing is a social sport, so you also want to keep up with your peers. So of course I want to perform! While I am more conscious of my behaviour, there is a difference between awareness and a shift in conduct.\nMind you, the world isn’t as black and white as our brain perceives. This specific drive isn’t inherently good or bad. I often find a lot of the beauty in this world beyond the surface, by peeling back layer after layer, at the cost of my energy. Concepts on a deeper level allow you to view the same thing differently. For instance, understanding Jackie Chan’s style transformed my view of martial arts movies. Yet, I want to learn how to control the on/off switch for this pattern.\n\n\n\nWork Stress Statistics made by TNO\n\n\nFalling back into my pattern, I looked for answers beyond the surface. Statistics from TNO revealed that in 2022, 1.3 million individuals exhibited burnout symptoms—nearly 1 in 5 people. This study examined work, while work can be a catalyst, it doesn’t account for everything. A holistic view is essential. What drives so many people to stretch their limits?\nSimply stated, when you spend more energy than you gain, you are at risk. The group of people who are unsatisfied unless it is perfect seems to be growing. As the pressure to do everything right increases with societal expectations. And you want to do things right because we grow up in a society where you only deserve something based on your achievements (merit). Could this be a by-product of our meritocratic society? Consider this insight from Byung-Chul Han’s The Burnout Society (Müdigkeitsgesellschaft).\n\nThe achievement-subject stands free from any external instance of domination [Herrschaftsinstanz] forcing it to work, much less exploiting it. It is lord and master of itself. Thus, it is subject to no one—or, as the case may be, only to itself. It differs from the obedience-subject on this score. However, the disappearance of domination does not entail freedom. Instead, it makes freedom and constraint coincide. Thus, the achievement-subject gives itself over to compulsive freedom—that is, to the free constraint of maximizing achievement. Excess work and performance escalate into auto-exploitation. This is more efficient than allo-exploitation, for the feeling of freedom attends it. The exploiter is simultaneously the exploited. Perpetrator and victim can no longer be distinguished. Such self-referentiality produces a paradoxical freedom that abruptly switches over into violence because of the compulsive structures dwelling within it. The psychic indispositions of achievement society are pathological manifestations of such a paradoxical freedom.\n\nYeah.. it wasn’t the easiest book I have read. In summary, we’ve become our own bosses, enjoying all the freedom that comes with it. However, on the flip side, when you say you can do it to yourself it often exerts more pressure than the statement you must do it from others. Because one is a failure of your own potential, the other merely an instruction. This mentality slides into all aspects of our life.\n\n\nEntrepreneurs of Self\nWe’ve become entrepreneurs of ourselves, we are the product, and we are the ones creating the product. The traditional 9-to-5 routine does not exist as an entrepreneur because it is your livelihood, your responsibility. To succeed, you need to increase your productivity. This pressure builds up, up to the point where your internal drive refrains you from seeing your boundaries. Hilariously, we often fail to implement one of the simplest thing to do for a better product: do less.\nThis simplicity, however, doesn’t mean it is easy, the hardest thing is saying ‘no’ to ourselves. In the pursuit of excellence and self-fulfilment, we often find ourselves caught in our ambitions. Our drive to achieve, while undeniably empowering, can also blind us to the signs of overextension. While acknowledging our limits and embracing the art of ‘no’ can help us, I do not feel they solve the root cause.\nUnfortunately, I do not have an answer but only reflections on my pursuit. I want to fuel my drive with passion, not with perfection. To look and appreciate the process, just as you would climb a mountain. Enjoy the fun when you ponder over the next move and feel the rock as you pull off the most efficient move to go higher. The view at the end is beautiful, but I am now questioning if I need it to appreciate the climb. I am consciously showing gratitude to the small steps in life. I feel it helps me slowly inch towards gratification in my mind and heart. It’s through the journey of self-discovery that we truly learn how to traverse them, and in the process, rediscover the beauty of both ascent and stillness.\n\n\n\nA building in the Generalife of the Alhambra, the art and passion in the small details make it one of the best places I have ever been to."

    "text": "Introduction\n\nDo you ever feel like a plastic bag drifting through the wind? - Firework\n\nIf you read this, you probably know me. I like to think, grow, and reflect. Let me give you a window into my world. This is a series of posts where I will reflect on my personal journey. Welcome to When you do not know where to go.\n\n\nWhen you do not know where to go.\n\n\nI am absolutely mesmerized by the devotion of the practitioners in the BBC show Sacred Wonders. This show showcases how faith drives ordinary individuals to do amazing things. From the Shaolin warrior monks to the bearers of the Esperanza throne, and the masons of the Djenne Great Mosque, they seem guided by forces greater than themselves, uncovering their true selves in the process.\nI often compare this kind of drive in life to the Andalusian shepherd boy from The Alchemist. A tale by Paulo Coelho following the main character in pursuit of his Personal Journey. The main theme to abandon the familiar and chase a dream is profoundly inspiring. It is a fixed journey. But when I revisit its pages, I encounter paragraphs full of life lessons that evoke a sense of envy. The transformation of the shepherd boy on his adventure is beautiful to witness, and something I want to experience first-hand.\nYet, if I were to think what dream I’d willingly forsake everything for, I come up empty-handed.\n\n“My Heart Is Afraid that it will have to suffer, [in pursuit of his dreams]” the boy told the alchemist one night as they looked up at the moonless sky. “Tell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself. And that no heart has ever suffered when it goes in search of its dreams.” — The Alchemist\n\n\n\nThe Never-Ending Journey\nWhile The Alchemist inspires me, it is Siddhartha by Herman Hesse that resonates most deeply within me. In this beautiful novel, the protagonist embarks on a spiritual journey, defying the wishes of his family and forsaking his home. His journey meanders through various roles as he seeks enlightenment. His encounters include the Buddha himself, a wise ferryman, and a woman of unparalleled beauty, all intertwining in a narrative that encapsulates the pursuit of the seemingly unattainable.\nThe protagonist’s transformation stems from his quest to vanquish an ever-present sense of emptiness. Born into the Brahman caste, scholarly pursuits revealed themselves as conduits to restlessness, not peace. He then embarked on a journey as a Samana, forsaking materialistic trappings and embracing the life of a beggar. Yet, in his pursuit of solace through meditation and fasting, he uncovered that these practices offered mere escape, rather than true self-discovery. As a disciple of the Buddha, while the teachings were profound, they also underlined the individual nature of the journey, a pilgrimage each must navigate personally to attain enlightenment. Every role left him unfulfilled in some way, as they were too focussed on one particular aspect rather than the holistic nature of life.\n\n\n\nCanal in the Rain – The Ferryman (Rik Wouters)\n\n\nBoth books are about self discovery on a journey, however, there is something more immersive with Siddhartha, as he cannot find his conclusion in just one part of his life. Ultimately, his enlightenment isn’t found in the expected places, but serendipitously, besides a river. I’ll not spoil the rest as I believe the story is worth reading yourself. It’s a beautiful conclusion and made me take a step back to reassess my perspective on life. I realized that I sensed a similar absence in my existence—a repetitive routine, each life stage prescribed as an obligatory chore: school, job, and so on. It took time for me to acknowledge that neither my academic achievements nor work accomplishments could fill the void.\n\n“When someone seeks,” said Siddhartha, “then it easily happens that his eyes see only the thing that he seeks, and he is able to find nothing, to take in nothing because he always thinks only about the thing he is seeking, because he has one goal, because he is obsessed with his goal. Seeking means: having a goal. But finding means: being free, being open, having no goal.” — Siddhartha\n\n\n\nThe Starting Point\nNo, I do not have the same drive as these extreme practitioners. I don’t envy their feats, but rather, their sense of fulfilment. In today’s world, attaining this feeling is not simple. For me, what is there to be proud of?\nMy parents came from a village in a mountainous region of China. My mom tells me stories about using icicles as dinner to satisfy their hunger during the winter. On the other side, my dad once cut trees, hauling them down mountainsides to construct homes. With minimal education, they relocated to the Netherlands in pursuit of a better life for their family. Which was all but easy, coming to a foreign country with different customs and systems with an enormous language barrier.\nI recognize that the opportunities and upbringing that moulded me into the person I am today would not have been accessible if I were born in China. We came from far and while I am grateful, my own achievements pale in comparison.\nMy random achievements—earning cum laude at TU Delft, triumphing over social anxiety to become a board member, conquering my swimming phobia at age 25, and finding a good job—often fail to evoke substantial pride. It’s akin to reaching a mountaintop by car versus hiking with a burdensome backpack. The vista might be the same, yet the sense of accomplishment is different. While it feels daunting at first, I often look back: was that it?\n\n\nFinding It\nBut even without this background, it is even more harmful when you start degrading your own achievements in life. At some point the achievements will blend together to become a grey blend of nothing. Part of the daily routine. While reading Daniel Kahneman’s Thinking, Fast and Slow, I stumbled upon an intriguing insight. Supported by multiple experiments, our emotional peaks and endings dominate our overall feelings about an experience. Applying this to my own accomplishments, the sense of pride seems to get overshadowed by the stress (peak) and fatigue (end). There’s a mismatch between the actual experience and my memory of it.\nI feel this might be one of the reasons why I have been directionless for quite a long time. Letting myself being swept wherever the wind blows. And to be honest, I don’t really know how to find a purpose in life. But so far, I have been enjoying the ride. By comparing the Alchemist and Siddhartha, I realized, the search can become never-ending. Longing for more and better every time. But it does give our life a certain meaning, a way for our heart to express itself. See the progress and challenges along the way.\nUnfortunately, I will have to end this post as directionless as I started it. But that is ok, there is a chance I might go on an epic journey at some point. Or not. I might keep searching and never finding it till I get old. Or not. But for now, I am happy with the progress I have made to face such a journey.\n\nDon’t feel guilty if you don’t know what you want to do with your life. The most interesting people I know didn’t know at 22 what they wanted to do with their lives. Some of the most interesting 40-year-olds I know still don’t. - Wear Sunscreen"

    "text": "There are experiences in life which transcends all other experiences. In this post, I want to tackle the impossible challenge of explaining my transformation journey over the last few years.\nI have struggled for almost a year now to put my thoughts into writing. While I sat down listening to my Jazz Soul Cafe playlist on multiple nights, the rhythm never seemed to reach my keyboard. Sentences after sentences have faced the wrath of the delete button. This was a source of constant frustration which eventually led to a loss of motivation. I wanted to put this profound experience in writing, I wanted to share this with everyone. And nothing came of it. But why is it so difficult to write about my transformation?\nAs I pick up this draft to work on it, I notice that my mind has put a layer of dust over the original words. It makes me wonder, can I even retrieve how my mind looked like before my current self? Our memories seem to be a dynamic in nature, by recalling it we subtly influence it by who we are in the moment.\nThe perception of how we view the event are an internal process, and if you go to therapy, you know the usual treatment is to change these processes. Cognitive behavioral therapy is nothing more than framing experiences in a different light. Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing focuses on sensory stimulation rather than the trauma to help process emotions. The whole of psychology is built on the fundamental assumption that internal processes can be altered, that is why the same event can have such different consequences for different persons. But wouldn’t the same be true for one person in two different time points? A transformation by definition creates a new version of you but its profoundness is mostly felt by the old you. That is why the new me now has this impossible task.\nAdding to that, a transformation is inherently a quale2, a subjective conscious experience, the ‘what it is like’ phenomenon. An example of a quale is how different people experience the color red. It is impossible to explain the redness of red, which might leave the possibility open that we are seeing different colors but still describing it the same. My favorite example however is one performed by Stratton3, in which he wore special glasses that caused the world to be upside down. But after a few days and probably a lot of stumbling around, his view adapted and everything appeared upright to him again. While you can use analogies or descriptions, it will never be a complete description of this experience. According to the philosophy of mind, qualia are something that cannot be communicated by definition.\nYet, so many people try sharing their experiences. The author going for the Nobel Prize of Literature, the painter putting his mind on canvas, the director filming the next blockbuster for the cinema, the musicians rocking on stage, and the actors with spotlights on their face in the theater. The relationship between a creator and their audience is complex. The creator tries to convey their experiences but it is not possible to get all of it across. The audience, with their own perspectives, biases, and life experiences, take this content and create their own interpretations from it.\nThe relationship creates an intriguing paradox: the creator’s transformed perspective and the audience’s separate interpretations never fully align, yet a shared understanding can emerge. The audience may never see transformation exactly as the creator experienced it, and the creator can’t fully control how the audience interprets their work. But in that gap between intention and interpretation, something beautiful and communal arises—a shared experience of something elusive, like glimpsing the same mountain from different sides. This act of creation is what brings value."

Approximately three months after I came back. What have I learnt? And what stayed the same?\n\nI am writing this at a phase where I feel tired every day. Physically and mentally. The anxiety that I have that this is another burn-out makes it even worse. While I feel proud of what I have done, I can’t stop thinking if it wasn’t too much? When is enough enough? When can I stop? I don’t know. My mind does not seem to have a stop button. I need to think about it more. I am juggling three assignments at work. And I do this? Even though I have time for myself, it does not seem enough. But what is the alternative? Doing nothing? Can I also stop daydreaming that I am better? Why do I feel the need to be good. I am happy with myself but there is some part of my mind that disagrees. I remember having these thoughts during the worst periods of my thesis. I managed to go through them but I didn’t solve the underlying issue apparently. Solving. That is fun. Like it can be solved? What if I think differently, what if I transform these thoughts into something that will help me. I have to step off the treadmill and do things I want to do. Look for what makes things fun. Mr. Nobody lessons.\n\n\nObstakels in mijn leven.\nHier heb ik een video van Tommy Caldwell die voor het eerst de Dawn Wall heeft beklommen in Yosemite. Ik las de opdracht en besloot deze video te sturen omdat mijn hoofd nog in de bergen zit. Ik had een verhaal voorbereid over de mentale angst die je bij het klimmen krijgt maar dat je soms moet leren vallen om verder te gaan.\nMaar toen ging ik verder denken over obstakels in het leven en wil ik een andere richting aan deze video geven. Want ik stond heel lang niet stil bij de obstakels die ik heb gehad, als kind sta je er ook niet heel lang bij stil. In principe had ik dezelfde struggles als de meeste andere biculturele mensen in de arbeidersklasse: gebrekkig taalgebruik in de familie, alleen basisschool-educatie ouders, en de consequenties van armoede. Maar toch door geluk en mijn omgeving de sociale ladder beklommen. Het is best wel recent dat ik eigenlijk hierop trots ben geworden, want het voelde heel erg dat het gewoon normaal was. Iedereen verwachtte het ook. Het werd zelfs zo erg dat ik mijn ouders niet eens had verteld dat ik cum laude was geslaagd en dat ze het te horen kregen van een studiegenoot die me tijdens de uitreiking feliciteerden. Toen moest ik ook nog uitleggen wat het was.\nGoed, toen ik dit realiseerde had ik tegen mezelf ook gezegd dat ik eigenlijk totaal niet aan die verwachtingen wil doen. Ben daarom maar expliciet dingen gaan doen die me uit mijn comfort zone brengen, zoals door mijn sociale angst te overkomen door een bestuursjaar te doen, of mijn zwemdiploma dit jaar te halen, of helemaal alleen naar een trouwfeest te gaan, of gedisciplineerd te gaan hardlopen, of al mijn traineeopdrachten.\nMaar goed, dit video laat wel zien hoe het oncomfortabele voelt. Het is moeilijk, angstig en frustrerend maar het voelt ook heel goed als het goed gaat. Zit nu wel in een fase waarbij ik het liever wel rustiger aan wil doen, maar dat voelt wel weer saai."

    "text": "Enough about the struggle of writing—let me tell you what I actually did! It’s not every day that life invites you to take things to the next level, but my coach, Andre, did exactly that. He challenged me to step out of my cozy routine and train resilience, combining mental strength with cold exposure. The idea sounded exhilarating, but I was hesitant.\nBut I knew that these were the kinds of challenges you should always say yes to. As much as I looked forward to the physical test, I knew the real journey would be within. But I had doubts too. Is it effective? Was I ready to face myself? Ready to do this with a group of strangers?\nAs I thought about Andre’s challenge, I decided to ask my friend Joey to accompany me. He said almost yes immediately as he got a similar recommendation at work. It does seem quite funny that personal development is such a point of focus at work. Want to find a way to deal with the stress of office work? Go force yourself to take a ice bath in Norway. It comes back to the entrepreneurs of self where everything we do is to increase productivity, otherwise you fall behind. A rat race. Again I got doubts on the programme’s effectiveness but sometimes you have to row with the oars you have been given.\nEveryone who knows Andre will tell you he has a gift to get the real answers out of you. Too often I answered one of his questions with a layer of nuance, too often I did not answer what I wanted to say but what I thought others wanted to hear, and too often I covered my answers in doubt. It has been a long journey but now I can say fuck nuance1, to listen and respect what I want to hear, and not let my doubts stop me from the beauty of life. All because Andre knew what my answer would be that day: yes.\n\n\n\nGoing for a morning run with Andre in Norway.\n\n\nI decided for myself that I can only start this journey the right way, by getting out of my comfort zone. I opened my Interrail app and entered Rotterdam Centraal in the From section of the planner, and Oslo as destination.\nAnd off I went."

I prepared myself to sleep at a nice bench with nobody around, but unfortunately, I was quickly removed by the station guards. I asked them where would be suitable to spend my next few hours and luckily, they showed the way to a big indoor bus stop but outside of the train station. And I thought to myself, maybe I should think about this more the next time. I made my way there and saw the people with the backpacks again.

There is no doubt in my mind that we can rationalize this and give arguments why the preferrer answer to a houseless person is ‘no’ but I also believe it comes from emotions. Such as shame, knowing that they have a hard time but not really being able to do anything about it. Or a fear, that its possible for everyone to become houseless, so you divert your attention otherwise that fear only grows. The clock had hit just past 1 AM now, and I sensed my anxiety spiking. While I share a lot of sympathy with the houseless, my mind told me there was also a danger if I slept now. Would my backpacks be safe? Would I?\nI don’t know if my ‘benchmate’ could sense my anxieties (he took the bench alongside me) but he struck up a conversation. “Hey, what is your name?” And so I replied. Our conversation probably lasted less than thirty minutes, as you could feel our tiredness set in. However, our talk managed to remove all those unknown variables. He was a middle-aged man with a scruffy looking beard, carrying this Lidl bag and a thick green coat. The coat had seen better days. His English was quite solid with a hint of a German accent. I found out my benchmate had lived and worked all across northern Europe moving from city to city. A real nomad. Never with a real place to stay. He would go where the work was, often something very labor intensive and then sleep wherever he could. He would have to get up early this morning too. I did not ask where the money went if it was not for accommodation but he did mention a family. And just like that, the unknown became known. My anxiety calmed down as I didn’t see him anymore as someone who could have been anyone but now I see an incredible worker.\nHearing his story, it weirdly made me envious. Anything difficult is worth doing. And if he didn’t have a difficult story. Other difficult stories often comes with a beautiful end where someone ‘started from the bottom’ and are now at their top. It didn’t seem he thought about a top but rather tried to make a living at the bottom. And these benches were definitely designed to make your sleep as uncomfortable as possible. My whole body already started to ache and he would do this day after day. I was falling asleep with my thoughts on a nomad lifestyle when I suddenly awoke with bright lights and loud yelling. The security guards had come again, to tell us the bus stop was now closed too. I don’t remember the time, could have been 2 or 3 AM. They told me they would open again in 2 hours.

After another good thirty minutes of searching I managed to find a bench next to the train tracks with good lightning. There was also a train available but I did not dare to enter it in case they would move it for maintenance. I sat my stuff down and I only started to think on the reason. It did seem a hotspot for the houseless but during my stay, there was no disturbance or any problems at all. This closure of the bus stop had the only intention to bully.

The anger I feel to see how we treat them. They say that outside of your comfort zone is when you learn the most, and I am so glad I did go outside my comfort zone. I have adopted a new belief, one in which we as a society simply don’t know how to deal with those who don’t have their basic needs met.

Because that lifestyle also removes your responsibility towards your environment.

    "text": "Thao and I.\n\n\nDear Thảo,\nIt has been a while since I wrote to you. I feel there is no thought untold as we talk every day, however, your birthday is a special occassion to reflect on the past year. A moment to take a step back from the day to day and look at the bigger picture. And what a beautiful picture it is. I remember celebrating your birthday last year in such a cozy way, with our homemade ramen and the tour through Rotterdam with some hot chocolate. It truly felt like Christmas magic. Does it feel long ago to you too? So much has happened since then.\nAt the end of December, we both left the country with the promise we would spend New Year together. Unfortunately, your year started with your phone stolen and plans didn’t go through. 2024 didn’t start off great, however, in these dark times is where light becomes more important. I remember going to your place on the 1st of January and cleaning your room. Despite the circumstances, I felt so strengthened as you and I showed how good of a team we can be.\nOur next challenge came at the end of April, where our relationship moved towards a new dimension. I still remember calling you from the trains through Europe, showing you the beautiful landscapes and wishing you were there with me. I wanted you every day as I felt a piece of me was gone. Even now while I read back on your letter you wrote on the plane to Vietnam, I feel emotion rush over me. We found each other. We built a love that we are fighting for. And we shaped a future together. All of this could not have happened if you weren’t an amazing partner. Sometimes I wonder, do we even realize how difficult this was because of how easy we managed to stay connected? I have seen love once described as “the euphoria of understanding and being understood, of your solitude cracking wide open.” And every day I want to ask you how your day was because I never regret knowing more about you, understand you better and show myself to you.\nThen the period when I came to Vietnam. Where I met your family, where I saw the places that shaped you who you are, and enjoyed the food and culture of this beautiful country. But also where our families met for the first time with your parents and my siblings. I saw the wonders of the country but in my eyes you were the biggest beauty. I saw your resolve and strength, you passed the Dutch exam, you got a job, you planned so much, you drove me around Ho Chi Minh, you balanced me and your life. It was a beautiful moment in time together, seeing how our life could look like living together. I want that life with you.\nThen a lot has happened since then but to be honest, it feels like a blur. You started working and became this amazing expert despite the hard working culture. We got a place for ourselves. We got the paperwork so you can move here. We are talking about buying furniture and things for our place. Our online conversations have become even weirder (who knew it was possible?). But this is also the period where things become uncertain again. You have to shake up your life and start somewhat anew in the Netherlands. As you told me, this move, unlike your previous travels, feel more permanent too. You are making choices that come with a huge cost and uncertainty to you. And I cannot know how it feels. But I am so grateful for you. In the past, you have asked me if I was surprised to see how much love I have in me for you. I want to ask you that same question. Because I am so thankful we can build this life together in our own world. And I’ll try to give you all the love you deserve, even when I know you deserve more love than I give.\nWhile I am sad I cannot celebrate the day in person, I am so grateful you are surrounded by your family and those who care about you. Enjoy your 25th my love, as the past year you and I have done 1001 things we can be proud of.\nYour love, Kevin"
