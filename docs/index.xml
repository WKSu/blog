<!-- > Inner peace. Enjoy. Follow your heart. See yourself.  -->
<!-- Who am I now? What kind of person do I want to be, both professionally and personally? What challenges me? And what gives me energy?  -->
<p>One magical journey in Norway transformed my whole life. Let me tell you that story.</p>
<section id="accepting-the-challenge" class="level1">
<h1>Accepting the Challenge</h1>
<p>Enough about the <a href="https://blog.kevinsu.nl/posts/20241101-transformation/">struggle of writing</a> let me show you what happened! It’s not every day that life invites you to take things to the next level, but my coach, Andre, did exactly that. It was on one of our usual walks in the city of Rotterdam when the topic of mental resilience came up. Andre is a tall man, with a serious gaze that comes across as intimidating. However, when you talk to him that disappears with his charismatic stories. Someone who tells the truth no matter how uncomfortable they are. He had experienced me at my lowest point and told me about this one week training in April. In Norway. The week is supposed to take me out of my cozy routine and confront myself internally, combined with cold exposure training. The idea sounded exhilarating, but I was hesitant.</p>
<p>As much as I looked forward to swim in a lake in freezing temperatures with the snow falling from the sky, I knew the real journey would be within. I had doubts. Is it effective? Was I ready to face myself? Ready to do this with a group of strangers?</p>
<p>As I thought about Andre’s challenge, I decided to ask my friend Joey to accompany me. This was something he would like as well, Mr.&nbsp;Mud Masters. He said almost yes immediately as he got a similar recommendation at work. It does seem quite funny that personal development is such a point of focus at work. Want to find a way to deal with the stress of office work? Go force yourself to take a ice bath in Norway. It comes back to the <a href="https://blog.kevinsu.nl/posts/20230617-climbing-my-mind-stop/">entrepreneurs of self</a> where everything we do is to increase productivity, otherwise you fall behind. A rat race. Again I got doubts on the programme’s effectiveness but I knew that these were the kinds of challenges you should always say yes to.</p>
<p>Everyone who knows Andre will tell you he has a gift to get the real answers out of you. Too often I answered one of his questions with a layer of nuance, too often I did not answer what I wanted to say but what I thought others wanted to hear, and too often I covered my answers in doubt. It has been a long journey but now I can say fuck nuance, to listen and respect what <em>I</em> want to hear, and not let my doubts stop me from the beauty of life. All because Andre knew what my answer would be that day: yes.</p>

<p>I decided for myself that I can only start this journey the right way, by getting out of my comfort zone. I opened my Interrail app and entered <em>Rotterdam Centraal</em> in the From section of the planner, and <em>Oslo</em> as destination.</p>
<p>And off I went.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-journey-before-the-journey" class="level1">
<h1>The Journey before the Journey</h1>
<!-- ![](train_route.jpg){width=30% .lightbox}  -->
<p><img align="right" img="" width="300" src="https://blog.kevinsu.nl/posts/20241109-norway/train_route.jpg"></p>
<p>A 20 hour journey on the train. 6 hours on a station overnight. Rotterdam Centraal. Amersfoort. Osnabrueck. Hamburg. Copenhagen Airport. Goteborg. <em>Sleep</em>. Oslo.</p>
<p><em>Fuck, its cold. And where did everyone go?</em> Those are my thoughts when I tried to sleep in Goteborg after being in the train since that morning. Everything went by so fast but it must have already been 16 hours since I left Rotterdam. A new record. Two months before I took the train to London for 4 hours. One month before it was 8 hours to Innsbruck. Now it doubled again. And I am still not at my destination. The time did not bother me, as I saw the world speed past by me. While I sat alone in carriages with a big water bottle, a good book and a journal. There is a peace to long distance train travel I cannot find anywhere else in this world. Many people have written about this feeling; the meditative peace when you are in a kind of in-between space, the rhythmic sound of the train moving along the tracks, the changing scenery, the shared space with strangers, and the feeling of being a passenger being freeing. It allows your mind to wander, and my mind kept asking me the same question: why did I do this?</p>
<section id="belief" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="belief">Belief</h2>
<p>And with ‘this’, I meant everything. Why did I take the train and not the plane like the rest? Why did I choose to (possibly) torture myself in the cold for ‘personal development’? Why did I want to develop myself anyways? Have I always been like this? After watching the green fields pass by and slowly starting to see more snow covered landscapes, I revealed a simple belief in me. <em>Anything difficult is worth doing.</em> To me, this means that the hardest path in life gives the satisfaction I yearn for. This satisfaction comes from multiple reasons. It is because the challenges on this path will be unlike anything you have seen before. It is because you don’t know anyone else who did it. It is because you come out of it better than you started. That is when you become a better version of yourself. And I tell myself I need to grow. Because that is good. Or is that the lie I tell myself because I think I am not good enough.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Know I know as well there are no good or bad beliefs. Our core beliefs are created in childhood and are difficult to change (ever seen Inside Out?). They are often related to our basic needs, if they are met and in what way. For example, if nobody listened to you as a child you’ll form the belief that your voice doesn’t matter. Based on this belief, you’ll perform actions to cope or overcompensate for this. It can range from not talking to always talking too much, the belief in itself is not harmful. But the actions could be, especially when they are pushed to the extreme. This creates a habitual pattern of thinking, a script you can stick to for your life. But beliefs often simplify and limit who we really are, who we could be. <a href="https://psyche.co/ideas/your-life-is-not-a-story-why-narrative-thinking-holds-you-back">Understand your beliefs but know, that is not your narrative. You can change your perception.</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Good, with that cold hard truth revealed in my mind I continued my journey. It never feels good to break down your ego like that but in this context, it felt like a huge relief. I was open to break down my walls in exchange for growth. And that was only possible because I removed myself from my daily patterns to think about this. What a beautiful start I thought, until I arrived at Goteborg Central.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-comfort-zone" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-comfort-zone">The Comfort Zone</h2>
<p>It was already close to 1 AM. Everything was closed and based on the schedule boards I was one of the last trains to arrive. I saw the flock of people leave towards the exit, leaving me behind with a few people with huge backpacks. The vacation goers looked frantically where to go next. I had not eaten dinner yet due to the short transfer times and was grateful for the sole Burger King that was open. After some bad but filling food, I wander around and text my family and friends about my situation. The next train is only 5 hours away, would be a waste to check-in a hotel right? I prepared myself to sleep at a nice bench with nobody around, but unfortunately, I was quickly removed by the station guards. I asked them where would be suitable to spend my next few hours and luckily, they showed the way to a big indoor bus stop but outside of the train station. And I thought to myself, maybe I should think more about this the next time. I made my way there and saw the people with the backpacks again. But I also saw a lot of other people, no backpacks but those who carry their life around in grocery bags.</p>

<p>To say I was out of my comfort zone is an understatement. I could feel my heart race a bit faster and my mind kick into survival-mode. I had never slept outside. And while I had shared rooms with strangers in hostels, those strangers felt were from similar walks of life. This was a totally new experience. <em>Anything difficult is worth doing</em> I repeated. There is a silent agreement it seems we have in our society. Or just me. But it is to look away at some of our fellow people when they need help the most. There is no doubt in my mind that we can rationalize this and give arguments why the preferrer answer to a houseless person is ‘no’. But for me, it comes from emotions. Such as shame, knowing that they have a hard time but not really being able to do anything about it. Or a fear, that its possible for everyone to become houseless, so you divert your attention otherwise that fear only grows. The clock had hit just past 1 AM now, and I sensed my anxiety spiking. While I share a lot of sympathy with the houseless, my mind told me there was also a danger if I slept now. Would my backpacks be safe? Would I? And I clutched my bags a little bit harder.</p>
<p>I don’t know if my ‘benchmate’ could sense my anxieties (he took the bench alongside me) but he struck up a conversation. <em>“Hey, what is your name?”</em> And so I replied. Our conversation probably lasted less than thirty minutes, as you could feel our tiredness set in. However, our talk changed my night. He was a middle-aged man with a scruffy looking beard, carrying this Lidl bag and a thick green coat. The coat had seen better days. His English was quite solid with a hint of a German accent. A voice that had a story to tell. I found out my benchmate had lived and worked all across northern Europe moving from city to city. A real nomad. Never with a real place to stay. He would go where the work was, often something very labor intensive and then sleep wherever he could. He would have to get up early this morning too. I did not ask where the money went if it was not for accommodation but he did mention a family. And just like that, the unknown became known. My anxiety calmed down as I didn’t see him anymore as someone who could have been anyone but now I see an incredible worker.</p>
<p>Hearing his story, it weirdly made me envious. <em>Anything difficult is worth doing</em>. And he was doing the difficult every day. Other difficult stories often comes with a beautiful end where someone ‘started from the bottom’ and are now at their top. It didn’t seem he thought about a top but rather tried to make a living at the bottom. And these benches were definitely designed to make your sleep as uncomfortable as possible. My whole body already started to ache and he would do this day after day. I was falling asleep with my thoughts on a nomad lifestyle when I suddenly awoke with bright lights and loud yelling. The security guards had come again, to tell us the bus stop was now closed too. I don’t remember the time, could have been 2 or 3 AM. They told me they would open again in 2 hours. While I slowly stood up and started walking to the exit, while not sleepwalking per se, I was not awake either. I remember thinking, this was the biggest bullshit I had ever seen.</p>

</figure>
</div>
<p>There was no point to this. We had to go outside (0 degrees Celcius yay!) and scatter around in the public space in search of a new spot. After another good thirty minutes of searching I managed to find a bench next to the train tracks with good lightning. There was also a train available but I did not dare to enter it in case they would move it for maintenance. I sat my stuff down and I only started to think on the reason. It did seem a hotspot for the houseless but during my stay, there was no disturbance or any problems at all. This closure of the bus stop had the only intention to bully. The same with the design of the benches. But none of these measures had solved the problem. I would say, it had only made them worse now that everyone is walking around in the middle of the night. I did not sleep outside, as I felt it was too open. I simply waited to go back inside.</p>
<p>Back inside, I had a new benchmate. This time no chitchat but I felt comfortable enough to get some shuteye. The uncomfortable feeling I experienced at the beginning of the night made way for understanding and anger. The understanding of a group of people I have not been in contact with ever in my life. The anger I feel to see how we treat them. They say that outside of your comfort zone is when you learn the most, and I am so glad I did go outside my comfort zone. I have adopted a new belief, one in which we as a society simply don’t know how to deal with those who don’t have their basic needs met. Where we apply measures that are broken, simply because they feel good but in its process lose our humanity.</p>
<p>While I started sleeping with my mind exploring the nomad lifestyle, this experience made me realize, that was not the answer. Not for me. My mind explored the van-life and all the privileges that come from it. Breaking my belief <em>Anything difficult is worth doing</em>, the life of my benchmate did not seem to be worth it. Or rather, not an active choice I would have made. That other life though? I was excited about the freedom that came from a nomad lifestyle, and it spiked my curiosity of the world. Moving from place to place while exploring the world and hearing people’s stories. But for now, I was brought back to reality. Because that lifestyle also removes your responsibility towards your environment. The kind of injustice the vulnerable in our society feel, is happening everywhere across the world, <a href="https://www.rijnmond.nl/nieuws/1617789/tientallen-mensen-houden-zitprotest-tegen-weghalen-bankjes-op-rotterdam-centraal-absurd">as well as Rotterdam</a>. And to fight against this injustice, it is not something I could have done in a van. A new belief revealed itself, I want to help.</p>
<p>I took the 6 AM train to Oslo. And the journey still has to begin..</p>

<!-- # I want something

My traineeship at the municipality is coming to an end, and I need some guidance onto the next phase of my life. Over the past 1.5 years, I have added more layers of depth to myself in and out of the workplace. I have acquired valuable skills at work, and personally, I've become more confident and assertive. With this growth comes unfamiliarity in a new territory.

It is not that I have never thought about the future. *"What do you want to be?"* is a question commonly asked since kindergarten. Yet, I never managed to find a satisfying answer to that question. Instead I kept my options open and picked the ones which allowed me to delay my answer. Being a generalist has its advantages but it also starts making you wonder where you belong if you fit in so many boxes. But in reality this answer can only follow after *"Who do you want to be?*.

To answer these questions I knew I had to leave my daily routine. When you are so busy with filling day after day with activities, taking time out for yourself for reflection takes a backdrop. There is no time to think of all the patterns you have created for yourself.

# I look for it

I wish I could say I immediately took the call to arms and embark on a profound journey of self-discovery, personal empowerment, and unyielding growth. But unfortunately, I had to go through some shit. A phase where I had no idea what to do or who I was. I have tried to capture my feelings of being [overwhelmed](https://blog.kevinsu.nl/posts/20230617-climbing-my-mind-stop/) and [lost](https://blog.kevinsu.nl/posts/20230812-do-not-know-where-to-go-directionless/). But the sharp reader will notice that these posts always end on a hopeful note. As it is during these times I feel I have accomplished the most.

I am fortunate enough that I am surrounded by a very supportive environment who help me through it Even in my darkest days, I manage to come back into the light. And this time, what beautiful light it is.

There is one place on earth, where nature isn't just a backdrop but the essence of the nation's soul. *Its dramatic landscapes, where fjords, like ancient scars, cut through rugged coastlines. Here, the sea, with its deep, impenetrable blues, embraces the land in a never-ending embrace, while towering cliffs reach out to touch the heavens.*

This beautiful description of Norway (which I should fairly attribute to ChatGPT), describes the fairytale feeling of my journey in *Telemark*. This white nature park celebrated our arrival with freshly fallen snow. In a cozy wooden cabin, that hides itself among the scenery with a pop of red, I unpacked my thick winter clothes. In the following days I will discover that they were not necessary. But seeing the night sky full of stars, I know it will be a sign for good things to come.

# I find it

This section has been the hardest for me to write, as seen in my previous post. How would I describe my personal growth without sounding like all the clichés slogans you can find from Xenos decorations? It is simply impossible as these words only get meaning when you have experienced themselves. However, I was not alone on this journey and I want to thank my fellow travelers for the way they influenced my path. And what makes it so special, even after such a long time I still feel a special kind of connection. We go through the motions together.  -->

  <title>Communicating my experiences</title>
  <link>https://blog.kevinsu.nl/posts/20241101-transformation/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>There are experiences in life which transcends all other experiences. I want to tackle the impossible challenge of explaining my transformation journey in Norway 2023.</p>
<section id="the-challenge-of-explaining-transformation" class="level1">
<h1>The Challenge of Explaining Transformation</h1>
<p>Back in 2023, while I sat down listening to my <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/jazz-soul-caf%C3%A9/pl.dcc30348803d4d2ab81642c87d933e90">Jazz Soul Cafe</a> playlist I thought of ways to put my journey into writing. I finally had something to write about. After all, I write to capture the sublime in my world. This transformation changed my path in life, nothing is more sublime than that.</p>
<p>Thus, the more frustrating it became when I couldn’t put my thoughts into writing. On multiple nights I deleted sentence after sentence in frustration. The rhythm of the songs never reached my fingers on the keyboard. It was a constant battle to write down what made it so special, without sounding like a cliche. I want to put this profound experience in writing, I want to share this with everyone. 2023 turned into 2024, and now I see 2025 creeping up. And nothing is happening. How do you put into words an experience that changed you so deeply that you’re no longer the same person?</p>

<section id="the-fluidity-of-memory" class="level1">
<h1>The Fluidity of Memory</h1>
<p>As I pick up this draft to work on it, I notice that my mind has put a layer of dust over the original words. It makes me wonder, can I even retrieve how my mind looked like before my current self? Our memories seem to be a dynamic in nature, by recalling it we subtly influence it by who we are in the moment. Memory is like a photograph that changes with each viewing.</p>
<p>The perception of how we view the event are an internal process, and if you go to therapy, you know the usual treatment is to change these processes. Cognitive behavioral therapy is nothing more than framing experiences in a different light. Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing focuses on sensory stimulation rather than the trauma to help process emotions. The whole of psychology is built on the fundamental assumption that internal processes can be altered, that is why the same event can have such different consequences for different persons. But wouldn’t the same be true for one person in two different time points? A transformation by definition creates a new version of you but its profoundness is mostly felt by the old you. That is why the new me now has this impossible task.</p>
</section>
<section id="communicating-qualia" class="level1">
<h1>Communicating Qualia</h1>
<p>Adding to that, a transformation is inherently a <em>quale</em><sup>2</sup>, a deeply personal, subjective experience. These are moments of subjective experience, like the way one person might see the color red differently from another. It is impossible to explain the redness of red, which might leave the possibility open that we are seeing different colors but still describing it the same. My favorite example however is one performed by Stratton<sup>3</sup>, in which he wore special glasses that caused the world to be upside down. But after a few days and probably a lot of stumbling around, his view adapted and everything appeared upright to him again. This shows how our perception can play all kind of tricks to make us think everything we see is ‘normal’, the same as everyone else. While you can use analogies or descriptions, it will never be a complete description of an experience. According to the philosophy of mind, qualia are something that cannot be communicated by definition.</p>

<section id="the-creator-audience-paradox" class="level1">
<h1>The Creator-Audience Paradox</h1>
<p>Yet, so many people try sharing their experiences. The author going for the Nobel Prize of Literature, the painter putting his mind on canvas, the director filming the next blockbuster for the cinema, the musicians rocking on stage, and the actors with spotlights on their face in the theater. The relationship between a creator and their audience is complex. The creator tries to convey their experiences but it is not possible to get all of it across. The audience, with their own perspectives, biases, and life experiences, take this content and create their own interpretations from it.</p>
<p>The relationship creates an intriguing paradox: the creator’s transformed perspective and the audience’s separate interpretations never fully align, yet a shared understanding can emerge. The audience may never see transformation exactly as the creator experienced it, and the creator can’t fully control how the audience interprets their work. But in that gap between intention and interpretation, something beautiful and communal arises—a shared experience of something elusive, like glimpsing the same mountain from different sides. This act of creation is what brings value.</p>
<p>Realizing the limitations in communicating my transformation, it helped me put my journey better onto paper. There is a beautiful kind of freedom realizing what you want is not possible. It opens your mind to what is in front of you. Switching it up to the smooth beats by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGK3YVmGZ3Y">KAYTRANADA</a> my thoughts are slowly pouring onto my screen. Transformation may be impossible to fully explain, but maybe that’s the beauty of it—it’s a mystery we’re all trying to understand, each in our own way. I invite you to join me on this journey as I attempt to put the intangible into words, one step at a time.</p>

<p>I am absolutely mesmerized by the devotion of the practitioners in the BBC show <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0007fhl">Sacred Wonders</a>. This show showcases how faith drives ordinary individuals to do amazing things. From the Shaolin warrior monks to the bearers of the Esperanza throne, and the masons of the Djenne Great Mosque, they seem guided by forces greater than themselves, uncovering their true selves in the process.</p>
<p>I often compare this kind of drive in life to the Andalusian shepherd boy from <em>The Alchemist</em>. A tale by Paulo Coelho following the main character in pursuit of his Personal Journey. The main theme to abandon the familiar and chase a dream is profoundly inspiring. It is a fixed journey. But when I revisit its pages, I encounter paragraphs full of life lessons that evoke a sense of envy. The transformation of the shepherd boy on his adventure is beautiful to witness, and something I want to experience first-hand.</p>
<p>Yet, if I were to think what dream I’d willingly forsake everything for, I come up empty-handed.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“My Heart Is Afraid that it will have to suffer, [in pursuit of his dreams]” the boy told the alchemist one night as they looked up at the moonless sky. “Tell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself. And that no heart has ever suffered when it goes in search of its dreams.” — The Alchemist</p>

<section id="the-never-ending-journey" class="level1">
<h1>The Never-Ending Journey</h1>
<p>While The Alchemist inspires me, it is <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2500">Siddhartha</a> by Herman Hesse that resonates most deeply within me. In this beautiful novel, the protagonist embarks on a spiritual journey, defying the wishes of his family and forsaking his home. His journey meanders through various roles as he seeks enlightenment. His encounters include the Buddha himself, a wise ferryman, and a woman of unparalleled beauty, all intertwining in a narrative that encapsulates the pursuit of the seemingly unattainable.</p>
<p>The protagonist’s transformation stems from his quest to vanquish an ever-present sense of emptiness. Born into the Brahman caste, scholarly pursuits revealed themselves as conduits to restlessness, not peace. He then embarked on a journey as a Samana, forsaking materialistic trappings and embracing the life of a beggar. Yet, in his pursuit of solace through meditation and fasting, he uncovered that these practices offered mere escape, rather than true self-discovery. As a disciple of the Buddha, while the teachings were profound, they also underlined the individual nature of the journey, a pilgrimage each must navigate personally to attain enlightenment. Every role left him unfulfilled in some way, as they were too focussed on one particular aspect rather than the holistic nature of life.</p>

</figure>
</div>
<p>Both books are about self discovery on a journey, however, there is something more immersive with Siddhartha, as he cannot find his conclusion in just one part of his life. Ultimately, his enlightenment isn’t found in the expected places, but serendipitously, besides a river. I’ll not spoil the rest as I believe the story is worth reading yourself. It’s a beautiful conclusion and made me take a step back to reassess my perspective on life. I realized that I sensed a similar absence in my existence—a repetitive routine, each life stage prescribed as an obligatory chore: school, job, and so on. It took time for me to acknowledge that neither my academic achievements nor work accomplishments could fill the void.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“When someone seeks,” said Siddhartha, “then it easily happens that his eyes see only the thing that he seeks, and he is able to find nothing, to take in nothing because he always thinks only about the thing he is seeking, because he has one goal, because he is obsessed with his goal. Seeking means: having a goal. But finding means: being free, being open, having no goal.” — Siddhartha</p>

<section id="the-starting-point" class="level1">
<h1>The Starting Point</h1>
<p>No, I do not have the same drive as these extreme practitioners. I don’t envy their feats, but rather, their sense of fulfilment. In today’s world, attaining this feeling is not simple. For me, what is there to be proud of?</p>
<p>My parents came from a village in a mountainous region of China. My mom tells me stories about using icicles as dinner to satisfy their hunger during the winter. On the other side, my dad once cut trees, hauling them down mountainsides to construct homes. With minimal education, they relocated to the Netherlands in pursuit of a better life for their family. Which was all <em>but</em> easy, coming to a foreign country with different customs and systems with an enormous language barrier.</p>
<p>I recognize that the opportunities and upbringing that moulded me into the person I am today would not have been accessible if I were born in China. We came from far and while I am grateful, my own achievements pale in comparison.</p>
<p>My random achievements—earning cum laude at TU Delft, triumphing over social anxiety to become a board member, conquering my swimming phobia at age 25, and finding a good job—often fail to evoke substantial pride. It’s akin to reaching a mountaintop by car versus hiking with a burdensome backpack. The vista might be the same, yet the sense of accomplishment is different. While it feels daunting at first, I often look back: was that it?</p>
</section>
<section id="finding-it" class="level1">
<h1>Finding It</h1>
<p>But even without this background, it is even more harmful when you start degrading your own achievements in life. At some point the achievements will blend together to become a grey blend of nothing. Part of the daily routine. While reading Daniel Kahneman’s <em>Thinking, Fast and Slow</em>, I stumbled upon an intriguing insight. Supported by multiple experiments, our emotional <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Peak%E2%80%93end_rule">peaks and endings</a> dominate our overall feelings about an experience. Applying this to my own accomplishments, the sense of pride seems to get overshadowed by the stress (peak) and fatigue (end). There’s a mismatch between the actual experience and my memory of it.</p>
<p>I feel this might be one of the reasons why I have been directionless for quite a long time. Letting myself being swept wherever the wind blows. And to be honest, I don’t really know how to find a purpose in life. But so far, I have been enjoying the ride. By comparing the Alchemist and Siddhartha, I realized, the search can become never-ending. Longing for more and better every time. But it does give our life a certain meaning, a way for our heart to express itself. See the progress and challenges along the way.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I will have to end this post as directionless as I started it. But that is ok, there is a chance I might go on an epic journey at some point. Or not. I might keep searching and never finding it till I get old. Or not. But for now, I am happy with the progress I have made to face such a journey.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Don’t feel guilty if you don’t know what you want to do with your life. The most interesting people I know didn’t know at 22 what they wanted to do with their lives.

<section id="the-climbing-journey" class="level1">
<h1>The climbing journey</h1>
<p>What is it that attracts people to bouldering &amp; climbing? At first glance the allure seems obvious: the physicality, the rush of accomplishment, and the tight-knit community all play their part. What more do you need? Yet, one aspect often goes unnoticed when discussing its attraction: personal growth.</p>
<p>As you embark on the climbing journey, you won’t notice it at the beginning, but a seed is planted within you. It takes root and begins to grow, evolving from a mere seedling to a mighty tree through nurturing and practice. It is the mentality you bring to life. Climbing continually pushes you beyond your limits, challenges you at every turn, and forces you out of your comfort zone. It presents you with new obstacles to overcome and conquer. What is it, if not an analogy for life?</p>
<p>If you read this, you probably know me. I like to think, grow, and reflect. Let me give you a window into my world. This is a series of posts where I will reflect on my personal journey. Welcome to <em>When you cannot stop</em>.</p>
</section>
<section id="you-can-do-it" class="level1">
<h1>You can do it</h1>
<div class="quarto-video ratio ratio-16x9"><iframe data-external="1" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PLd_c4CjG44" title="" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>One of the best visual representations of exploring your limits and not stopping. It seemed impossible to climb the Dawn Wall but Caldwell and Jorgeson found a way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This video remains etched in my memory. Watching this awe-inspiring feat makes my palms sweat and my body tense. How does one begin an endeavour everyone deems unattainable? What fuels the relentless attempts year after year, the refusal to surrender to defeat? For a long time, this fuelled my quest to explore my own limits in life. But today, I don’t wish to discuss the familiar <strong>you can do it</strong> mantra—akin to profit-driven companies assuring success upon purchase. I want to unveil the less discussed, the harmful side.</p>
<p>Have you ever felt like a train hurtling along tracks, station to station? But then, you decide you want to be more than just the rhythm of the rails. You want to go faster. It’s that inkling, that curiosity to glimpse the next stop or the desire ignited by the journeys of other trains. Yet, as your speed increases, inevitability rushes in — some stations will be missed. And there’s an even subtler twist, the possibility of not even regretting those skipped stations. 🛤️🚂</p>

<section id="lively-august" class="level1">
<h1>Lively August</h1>
<p><img align="right" img="" width="300" src="https://blog.kevinsu.nl/posts/20230617-climbing-my-mind-stop/lively-august2022.png"></p>
<p>Throughout the lively August 2022, my weekends were brimming with adventure. I finished the Rotterdam half-marathon. I went climbing in Berdorf, Freyr, and Pont-A-Lesse the following weekends after. Weekdays blurred into a medley of running, climbing, swimming, and, of course, work. I was hooked to the outdoor active lifestyle. At work, I had three amazing projects which I had to bring over the finish line still. This phase, the amazing feeling of conquering the summer run, the thrill of climbing, the joys of camping, and trying to contribute to my city came with a price. I was sprinting past my limits, carried away by my enthusiasm. All the achievements masked a subtle truth: I had done too much, too fast.</p>
<p>Life thrives on contradictions; too much of a good thing can be bad for you. I had seen this cliché up close this summer. I went beyond my physical limits and as our bodies and minds are intertwined, it also influenced my mental space. Tiredness and the feeling of blankness started to creep in, simply said, I was running low on serotonin.</p>
<p>The solution seems simple, start doing less things. Take time for yourself and reset. However, this experience left me with more questions than answers, not that I had the energy to think about it. Why was following this advice so difficult? Why did I not see this coming? What was it that drove me to ignore my limits and its consequences?</p>
</section>
<section id="old-pattern" class="level1">
<h1>Old Pattern</h1>
<p>Several months later, my energy was restored. Reflecting on these questions revealed a recurring pattern. It encompassed not just climbing and work but also extended to games, movies, and studies—an endeavor’s pursuit to do things right. The pattern is usually as follows, when I do something, I want to do it right. And if you want to do it right, you have to spend a lot of time and energy on it. It is easy to label this as perfectionism, but I believe it is more about seeking depth and going beyond the surface level. Ranging from optimizing my Guardian build in Guild War 2 for the perfect setup, to in-depth analyses on the cinematography of movies, to spending my nights till 4am on reports.</p>
<p>Returning to the present, as a trainee of the municipality, you get so much freedom to try to improve the city. The city I grew up in. And climbing is a social sport, so you also want to keep up with your peers. So of course I want to perform! While I am more conscious of my behaviour, there is a difference between awareness and a shift in conduct.</p>
<p>Mind you, the world isn’t as black and white as our brain perceives. This specific drive isn’t inherently good or bad. I often find a lot of the beauty in this world beyond the surface, by peeling back layer after layer, at the cost of my energy. Concepts on a deeper level allow you to view the same thing differently. For instance, understanding <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1PCtIaM_GQ">Jackie Chan’s style</a> transformed my view of martial arts movies. Yet, I want to learn how to control the on/off switch for this pattern.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://blog.kevinsu.nl/posts/20230617-climbing-my-mind-stop/werkstress.png" height="500" class="figure-img"></p>
<figcaption>Work Stress Statistics made by <a href="https://www.monitorarbeid.tno.nl/nl-nl/publicaties/factsheet-week-van-de-werkstress-2022/">TNO</a></figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Falling back into my pattern, I looked for answers beyond the surface. Statistics from TNO revealed that in 2022, 1.3 million individuals exhibited burnout symptoms—nearly 1 in 5 people. This study examined work, while work can be a catalyst, it doesn’t account for everything. A holistic view is essential. What drives so many people to stretch their limits?</p>
<p>Simply stated, when you spend more energy than you gain, you are at risk. The group of people who are unsatisfied unless it is perfect seems to be growing. As the pressure to do everything right increases with societal expectations. And you want to do things right because we grow up in a society where you only deserve something based on your achievements (merit). Could this be a by-product of our meritocratic society? Consider this insight from Byung-Chul Han’s <em>The Burnout Society (Müdigkeitsgesellschaft)</em>.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The achievement-subject stands free from any external instance of domination [Herrschaftsinstanz] forcing it to work, much less exploiting it. It is lord and master of itself. Thus, it is subject to no one—or, as the case may be, only to itself. It differs from the obedience-subject on this score. However, the disappearance of domination does not entail freedom. Instead, it makes freedom and constraint coincide. Thus, the achievement-subject gives itself over to compulsive freedom—that is, to the free constraint of maximizing achievement. Excess work and performance escalate into auto-exploitation. This is more efficient than allo-exploitation, for the feeling of freedom attends it. The exploiter is simultaneously the exploited. Perpetrator and victim can no longer be distinguished. Such self-referentiality produces a paradoxical freedom that abruptly switches over into violence because of the compulsive structures dwelling within it. The psychic indispositions of achievement society are pathological manifestations of such a paradoxical freedom.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah.. it wasn’t the easiest book I have read. In summary, we’ve become our own bosses, enjoying all the freedom that comes with it. However, on the flip side, when you say <strong>you can do it</strong> to yourself it often exerts more pressure than the statement <strong>you must do it</strong> from others. Because one is a failure of your own potential, the other merely an instruction. This mentality slides into all aspects of our life.</p>
</section>
<section id="entrepreneurs-of-self" class="level1">
<h1>Entrepreneurs of Self</h1>
<p>We’ve become entrepreneurs of ourselves, we are the product, and we are the ones creating the product. The traditional 9-to-5 routine does not exist as an entrepreneur because it is your livelihood, your responsibility. To succeed, you need to increase your productivity. This pressure builds up, up to the point where your internal drive refrains you from seeing your boundaries. Hilariously, we often fail to implement one of the simplest thing to do for a better product: do less.</p>
<p>This simplicity, however, doesn’t mean it is easy, the hardest thing is saying ‘no’ to ourselves. In the pursuit of excellence and self-fulfilment, we often find ourselves caught in our ambitions. Our drive to achieve, while undeniably empowering, can also blind us to the signs of overextension. While acknowledging our limits and embracing the art of ‘no’ can help us, I do not feel they solve the root cause.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I do not have an answer but only reflections on my pursuit. I want to fuel my drive with passion, not with perfection. To look and appreciate the process, just as you would climb a mountain. Enjoy the fun when you ponder over the next move and feel the rock as you pull off the most efficient move to go higher. The view at the end is beautiful, but I am now questioning if I need it to appreciate the climb. I am consciously showing gratitude to the small steps in life. I feel it helps me slowly inch towards gratification in my mind and heart. It’s through the journey of self-discovery that we truly learn how to traverse them, and in the process, rediscover the beauty of both ascent and stillness.</p>

<p>After spending time this year in Andalusia exploring the gorgeous mountains, learning about the historic period of Al-Andalus, and admiring beautiful architectural wonders it made me wonder what exactly it is I am looking for when I travel. I managed to get it down to my longing for the wilderness, to leave <em>humankind</em> behind me, and experience the incomprehensible that makes something great. Two articles have really helped me reflect and explore these thoughts: <a href="https://reallifemag.com/the-great-offline/">The Great Offline</a> and <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/a-dispatch-from-the-end-of-travels-brief-troubled-golden-age">The end of travel</a>. For this post I will share my thoughts of travelling in Canada.</p>
<p>As a disclaimer, travelling is such a uniquely personal experience which people can shape and form to seek their love for the world. The previous articles linked feel like criticisms in the ways people travel. In a liberal society people’s norms and values come from their own search. This freedom is a curse and a blessing. It’s curse as it creates a certain emptiness where you have little to fall back on during life’s constant dilemmas. As these values are often tied to each other’s identity, they can become fanatical and polarising as we see in contemporary’s politics. In this post I try to explore these questions in our uncertain times for myself and only myself. However, the blessing is that this freedom allows us to do things differently, much faster than before. Ideas are able to exist and influence next to each other. It allows the person to figure out what they want. I want to acknowledge the many different ways of travel and this post merely tries to help me in shaping my way.</p>

<section id="the-wilderness" class="level1">
<h1>The Wilderness</h1>
<!-- <img width="360" img align="center" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/Caspar_David_Friedrich_-_Wanderer_above_the_sea_of_fog.jpg"> -->
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/Caspar_David_Friedrich_-_Wanderer_above_the_sea_of_fog.jpg" class="img-fluid quarto-figure quarto-figure-center figure-img" width="360"></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The famous painting from Caspar David Friedrich titled “<em>Wanderer above the Sea of Fog</em>” (1818) has become my favourite piece of art as it so beautifully shows the allure of beautiful landscapes, especially at the top of mountains. There are most-likely thousands of articles written about this painting, the sublime, and its connection to German Romanticism but this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeG0EWhv38A">video</a> is my favourite. It beautifully shows Caspar David Friedrich’s other works, where humans feel small in these big ominous landscapes. There is a sense of solitude. It is what I experience when I am in the wilderness, surrendering to nature. It lets me know that we humans are part of Mother Earth connected to flora and fauna. Waking up in a forest to see the light scatter across the trees or see a gorgeous mountain with the stars hovering over it. To be humbled and experience the greatness of the forces of Nature is a beautiful experience. But it is in sharp contradiction with this Wanderer who seems to stand above it all. That is the feeling I get when I climb, when everything makes sense and you have an overview of what is happening in front of you. To be alone with yourself so you are able to find yourself. These are the best aspects of my travels.</p>
<p>However, just like with many things today there are contradictions. The concept of wilderness is a weird one, as eloquently put by Lauren Collee in <em>The Great Offline</em>:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In 1995, environmental historian William Cronon published “The Trouble With Wilderness; or, Getting Back to the Wrong Nature.” In it, he critiques the Western concept of “wilderness” as nothing but a fantasy that prevents us from meaningfully engaging with ecological systems. He argues that the idea of wilderness is beset by a central paradox: It supplies the “ultimate landscape of authenticity,” allowing for the purest expression of a human self, and yet it excludes human presence by definition (wilderness is wherever other humans are not). Wilderness thus remains a “profoundly human creation” — charged with individualism — in which we perceive not “nature,” but “the reflection of our own unexamined longings and desires.” … [wilderness] offer mythologies of ahistoricity and unaccountability, an escape clause from the dilemmas of a globalized world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The article is a hard reminder that you cannot simply disconnect from the rest of humankind and our shared history. Not only does it shape a pessimistic viewpoint in which escapism is needed to become happy, it creates more individualistic wants and needs in a very individualist society. I want to address two themes: one of exclusivity and another one of history.</p>
</section>
<section id="exclusivity" class="level1">
<h1>Exclusivity</h1>
<p>Isn’t it weird? I want people to leave astounding places of nature alone so a small group of privileged people are able to have these amazing activities in the wild. Otherwise all vacations will slowly move to a Disneyland experience: manufactured enjoyment, queues, and hordes of people everywhere. And I felt this battle while in the Canadian Rockies, as everything becomes more accessible with car thus great viewpoints and hikes were full of people. In a way some experiences felt diminished. You enter a full parking lot, while you hear familiar European languages all around you, and you keep going from place to place because now everything is accessible. Yet, I was there doing the exact same thing everyone else was doing.</p>
<p>Yet it is precisely accessibility what created my love for the outdoors. As a child, the Netherlands was all I was accustomed to. Born and raised where everything was safe and well-maintained. A large grass field with trees was the closest I have been to nature. That all changed when I travelled to China for the first time. My perception of the world and how everything worked changed. A big part of it was that my family became bigger. I am sure I had been told that I had more family members but it is only when you are constantly surrounded by them, you feel that you have more family members. Not even extended ones but I suddenly had a brother <em>and</em> a sister. They had stayed behind due to immigration issues.</p>
<p><img align="left" img="" width="300" src="https://blog.kevinsu.nl/posts/20220802-canada-travelling-nowadays/images/waterfall_china.JPG"></p>
<p>Most-likely connected in some deep psychological way I do not understand, the other big change was to experience the outdoors. My mom grew up in the mountains, hikes were not a way to get out of the city but rather needed to get to the essential services provided by the city. My granddad and dad used to cut trees up in the mountains, transport them down the self-made trails to make houses. While much of the standard of living had vastly improved since their youth (my siblings even had technology far more advanced than me: the laptop!), there was still an essence of it all around their birthplace. The feeling of home. However, I felt the outdoors call me the most the most when visiting the Baichuan Waterfall. Three waterfalls ranging from 200 meters to 12 meters on a simple and very accessible path, even a child could walk it, was the most spectacular thing I had seen. I got into such a high (or I drank some sacred mountain water) I had an outburst of energy going up and down the trail when we went back. This was the first time I fell in love with nature.</p>
<p><img align="right" img="" width="300" src="https://blog.kevinsu.nl/posts/20220802-canada-travelling-nowadays/images/amethyst_lake.jpg"></p>
<p>20 years later, the exact opposite gave me this ecstasy. The first few days in the Rockies we spent on this muddy, mosquito-infested, and sketchy river crossings backpacking trip in Tonquin Valley. This entire trail at most might have 30 people on them on a day, dropping more and more the farther you go, with only grizzlies, black bears, marmots, and caribou making up the rest of this population in this stunning hike. Because of the hard path, it felt like we earnt the beautiful views of the Ramparts and Amthyst Lake. The lake’s glacier cold water felt like a relief and a burst of energy just when we needed it. What was even better, there was nobody on our camp grounds at Surprise Point. If it hadn’t been for the mosquitoes I could have stayed there the entire trip. And be in bliss. Obviously a lot has changed from now and when I had my first waterfall experience, I have changed. But to truly let go of all of society’s expectations and chaos, it seems like I should go back to a time when I wasn’t burdened with this. That period can only be found in childhood. Where I was truly myself. Exclusivity was not necessary to enjoy the outdoors when I was a child, why is it now?</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>I suspected that one of the reasons I was so disconcerted by the narcissistic atmosphere of the selfie age was that it had exposed the solipsism of my own quest. For while I balked at ‘influencer’ superficiality, I also appreciated that my travel writing was just a more sophisticated version of the same tendency. I wondered how many other people might have been using travel in a similar, medicinal way – to curate a narrative, sometimes at the expense of subjective joy. - Henry Wismayer in The end of travel</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Henry Wismayer’s faced the same challenge when the theatre of travel changed. With everything becoming more accessible and cheap almost everything becomes Disneyland. You do not need to know the local language, neither do you need anything else except for your smartphone, internet, and money to get around. It feels too easy, therefore, it does not feel like I earn to be there. Instead of being grateful for the hard work of the national and provincial parks offering everyone the same opportunity to become more connected to nature my ego got in the way. Yet, in this piece I found some solace. To deeper understand my wants and needs when travelling but also when I am not. I cut down the dichotomy of travelling and non-travelling experiences.</p>
<p>My reasoning being that if I can capture the joys and wonder of my travels in everyday life, I have a lot more to enjoy. With this, I erase the pressure of wanderlust on my travels. This narcissistic view of travelling I have shaped comes from discontentment of the standard routine in my everyday life. I work, I play, I sleep. You appreciate the things you do not have when touring the unknown but it also creates a vivid contrast to your day-to-day life, making it that much more exciting. But who is to say these experiences cannot be had in your day to day life? These two experiences I have had on my travels were of mnemonic quality, mostly because they are new, they create a longer and lasting imprint in the brain. I had them before in everyday life but I was not seeking for them. This is a more conscious shift in mindset.</p>
<p>A concrete step I want to take is to write more about the beautiful city I feel at home in: Rotterdam. By documenting and taking pictures of the interesting places and events of this city I can create new experiences for myself without bringing the burden that I have to do unique things across the world. I can do them right at home.</p>

<h1>History</h1>
<p>In another time, exclusivity meant something else. The <em>wilderness</em> I explored in Canada was created by European settlers marking down these territories as theirs. In The Great Offline the concept of wilderness is often used to escape our shared responsibility and its history. This concept is used to hide certain narratives which are important for the betterment of the person and land. This has been far from my intended goal but I can see why it is dangerous. By looking at it from a systematic point of view, the lack of consciousness diminishes willpower and the quality of policies for fair use of the wild.</p>
<p>Knowing history and culture of places outside my known world is why I travel. My cultural trip entering the world of Al-Andalus with its mosque-cathedral of Córdoba and the Alhambra reminded me that my Eurocentric view of history diminishes and neglects important pieces of history. How could we call the period between 500-1500 the dark ages in Europe? When Córdoba became the leading cultural and economic centre exploding in innovations and cultural exchange due to the relative oasis of religious tolerance of the three major religions living together. The Great Offline has reminded me that my interests can extend further to become actionable as well. I have been on the look for more, not only to challenge the Eurocentric view of history but to find narratives I can use and apply in modern day life. Here are the small pieces I learnt in Canada.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>When Jasper Park Forest Reserve was created in 1907, later officially designated as Jasper National Park with the passing of the National Park Act in 1930, the natural landscape was initially understood as a backdrop for European settler recreation. Indigenous peoples were seen as obstacles to the enjoyment of nature. According to wilderness conservation policies at the time, Indigenous peoples were considered incompatible with nature and so couldn’t live in, hunt, or harvest within park boundaries. - <a href="https://www.pc.gc.ca/en/pn-np/ab/jasper/autochtones-indigenous">Parks Canada Jasper National Park</a></p>

</figure>
</div>
<p>The parks I have visited only exist as the First Nations and Métis were forcibly removed during their creation. Not only did they lose their land, they lost their way of living. The way Canada put in policies to assimilate the Indigenous people of these lands were shocking. They were a constant reminder of my privilege travelling these touristic vistas which should have been their lands for living, food, and gatherings.</p>
<p>My enjoyment of these glorious mountains were possible because the early European explorers “protected” this area. Erasing the lives and history of what came before. One big artefact of this is the way the places are named, often by colonists naming places after themself, children, pets, and employees.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>More often than not, places were named according to the whims of surveyors, cartographers, and politicians of the day. This is in stark contrast to the deeply meaningful, personal, and often spiritual naming practices of Indigenous peoples. - <a href="https://yellowheadinstitute.org/2019/10/08/reclaiming-indigenous-place-names/">Reclaiming Indigenous Place Names</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A small way for me to remember the heritage of Indigenous people is to find and add the names used by First Nations in my <a href="https://blog.wksu.ml/canada/climbing/2022/08/01/climbing.html">climbing post</a>. As a constant reminder of this event. I would like to thank the sporadic sources providing these Indigenous names<sup>1</sup>. However, I lacked a structural way to find the corresponding names, showcasing that the revitalization of these lands is very much starting. But this is not something that has happened a 100 years ago. The hurt and damages caused by these events can only be expressed in lifetimes. Canada is still dealing with the effects of harmful colonialism.</p>
<p>On my trip the Pope made an official apology on Canadian soil for the (sexual) abuse of Indigenous children in Catholic-run schools. From 1800s to <strong>the 1990s</strong> the Canadian government sent Indigenous children to government-sponsored schools to assimilate them into Euro-Canadian culture. The last one closed in 1996. An estimated 150,000 children were removed from their homes, separated from their siblings, and stripped off their culture. They would spend half a day at school and the other half working. The Pope, however, has yet to apologize for the Doctrine of Discovery<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“The discovery doctrine, also called doctrine of discovery, is a concept of public international law that was promulgated by the Catholic Church and European monarchies in order to legitimize the colonization and evangelization of lands outside Europe.” - <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Discovery_doctrine">Wikipedia</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 2015 reported that at least 3200 children have died in these schools. In May 2021, the Tk’emlúps te Secwépemc First Nation used ground-penetrating radar technology at one residential school in Kamloops to discover the remains of 215 children. The reported number was only 50 in 2015. The suspected number of dead children are way higher, in the multitude of thousands.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>A common tactic seems to be targeting minorities especially when they are doing well, setting them back for generations again. The <a href="https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/peasant-farm-policy">Peasant Farm Policy</a> restricted the First Nations ability to participate in this “new” world. As they were performing quite well in agriculture due to their inherent knowledge of the lands, policies were created to restrict their types of tools, how much they grew and could sell. The policymakers applied Darwinism to argue that the Indigenous people were not evolved enough for contemporary methods of farming.</p>
<p>I was not only exposed to the policies against the Indigenous but also against the Chinese, such as the <a href="https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/chinese-head-tax-in-canada">Chinese Head Tax</a> between 1885 and 1923. As you have to pay more based on your ethnicity. It was Canada’s first legislation to exclude immigration on the basis of ethnic background. It got replaced with the Chinese Immigration Act in 1923 banning Chinese immigration and scattering families across the globe. This does not even include the harassment and rampant discriminations<sup>3</sup> towards Chinese-owned businesses, as British Colombia passes laws restricting Chinese wholesalers, farmers, and storekeepers by restricting services regulating quantities and prices. With numerous attempts to limit businesses owned by non-whites claiming “White Canada Forever”<sup>4</sup>.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>All across Canada, starting in the 1890s, cities and larger towns began to develop their own Chinatown districts. These areas were safe places for Chinese people to live, to find Chinese goods, and to meet socially. People who wanted to harass the Chinese would be less likely to do so when many Chinese people lived and worked close by and could fight back. Chinatowns often emerged in older, poorer parts of town which were less desirable. - <a href="https://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/discover/immigration/history-ethnic-cultural/early-chinese-canadians/Pages/history.aspx">History of Canada’s early Chinese immigrants</a></p>

<p>Nowadays, the policies against the Indigenous and the Chinese have resulted in an interesting mix in the big cities of Canada. I very vividly remember the first time I was getting food in Chinatown in Edmonton. Expecting Asian restaurants and well, a feeling of familiarity, I was completely unprepared for what I have seen. This view will stay with me for a long time: rows and rows of tents of the houseless on the streets with multiple people sleeping on the pavements of the parking lot of the shiny Rogers Place (stadium costing $604.5 million). It brought a feeling of unease to see the wealth disparity this clearly in front of me. The same situation uncovered in Vancouver, while I did not take a picture as I felt intrusive - I am sad I am unable to share this vivid image with everyone. <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=canada+homeless+chinatown&amp;t=h_&amp;iar=images&amp;iax=images&amp;ia=images">A search on the internet</a> might provide some context but I do not believe it truly captures what is happening in these cities. Chinatowns attract the houseless as these areas are often less developed, whereas the Indigenous people have lost their culture and families becoming houseless. While I can only speak for Edmonton and Vancouver, they are a stark reminder of big city problems. Ones I can work on.</p>

<p>However, unlike The Great Offline I don’t believe this is the responsibility of everyone. For example, I am very limited in what I can do in Canada but fortunately I have decided to go to work in the Dutch public sector where I can apply these lessons. While I agree with the premise of The Great Offline, as we should strive for a view in which wilderness isn’t one where its void of humanity but rather allow the possibility of sustainable cohabitation. This perspective is one filled with more optimism than the one I held. Yet I disagree on a personal level, shirking responsibility applies to all forms of escapisms, and if I may, it sucks to burden people in their escapist pleasure. Everyone has their own way of helping and dealing with the world. People should have this freedom. Does this mean they can be respectless or ignorant towards the land they use? No.&nbsp;But it should not feel like the burden is solely on the thrill-seeking mountaineer who wants to venture into the wilderness. We all have our vices.</p>

<h1>The End</h1>
<p>In this post I shared my thoughts on exclusivity and mass tourism, while also diving into the history and accountability of these places I have visited. While writing this article I had a fun serendipitous moment in the train from Amsterdam to Rotterdam where a group of people discussed religion and morality. It reminded me that our moral compass in history has shifted a lot over the centuries and will continue to do so. While we lacked tolerance towards different religions, ethnicities, sex, and sexuality we have progressed a lot (this sentence comes with a disclaimer based on location, age, social group, and also recognizes the progress that can be made more). Even as these attitudes and policies have created artefacts and hurt visible now and for generations to come. We seem to be standing and working in other areas where we are actively expanding our moral compass again. To give rights to the voiceless. The way we treat animals, nature, future generations, to name a few, will also make us think how we travel and enjoy our vices. We still live in uncertain times, some might even call it the precipice, and one way to go through it is by acknowledging this ambiguity.</p>

<p>Certain topics of travel remain undiscussed. I have yet to finalize my thoughts on the contradictions of harmful travelling to enjoy our beautiful world, while my whole presence of being there (in)directly harms the land. I flew to Canada, I drove a car in Canada. I don’t think I felt comfortable doing this but feeling locked into this system, I don’t think I would be happy either not going. But this is it for now, I feel like I will write more about the other things I have seen in Canada when I can create a coherent story out of them. The only thing you really need to know is that you must visit a Ramen Danbo.</p>
<p>I enjoyed writing this blog post and using my travel journal to collect memories of these moments, it has made me a more conscious traveller. I have remembered way more than my usual trips. These posts were written by a very jetlagged person, who also decided to run a half marathon two days after he came back to get even more tired. Hopefully it still is coherent. Thank you for reading and have fun!</p>

----------

Goede voornemen voor het nieuwe jaar 

Terug naar de basis; het sublieme waarderen in de onnatuurlijke wereld.

Terug van mijn trip van Al-Andalus: een verloren geschiedenis van de Islamtische wereld op het Europese continent. Het heeft me geinspireerd over de maatschappij en de geschiedenis die we onthouden. Een plek waar drie grote religies (islam, christendom, jodendom - wel met belasting voor de laatste twee) met elkaar samenleefden. Een van de eerste vormen. Cordoba was de kennisstad van Europa met grote ontdekkingen in trigonomie, astronomie, gezondheid en agricultuur. Hoezo dark ages / duistere middeleeuwen? 

Mijn reflectie op deze trip heeft me wakker gemaakt over mijn verlangen naar de wildernis; een vorm van escapisme om de wereld achter je te laten. Je bent alleen met jezelf. En hierdoor kan je jezelf gaan vinden. Mijn pad om de angst achter je te laten en te ontdekken wie ik nou ben. 

Caspar David Friedrich is een Duitse kunstenaar bekend om zijn romantische wilde van natuurlijke landschappen. Hierin wordt gestreven naar het sublieme: het onbevattelijke wat iets groots maakt. Wanneer is iets mooi en wanneer is het groter dan dat? 

Ik verlang naar de natuur. Ik verlang specifiek naar wandelen door de bergen die je klein maken. Dit wordt in contrast gezet wanneer je eindigt op de top waar je de wereld aan je voeten hebt. Deze ervaring is subliem. 

Alleen is dit een privilege die niet ten alle tijden beschikbaar is. Hoe kan ik naar het onbevattelijke gaan zoeken in mijn dagelijkse leven? Mijn antwoord op dit moment is het begrijpen van de kunstvormen om je heen. 

Counterargument: maar je hebt geen kennis nodig om het sublieme te begrijpen in de natuur. Waarom heb je dat wel nodig voor de hedendaagse cultuur? Omdat je wordt doodgegooid met alles en nog wat; je hebt een framework nodig om het goede en het slechte van elkaar te kunnen scheiden. Dit heb je niet altijd nodig, maar hoe sterker je deze scheiding kan maken, hoe meer je het goede gaat waarderen. 

A blog article a week?

<section id="introduction" class="level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>By going into nature, I am trying to get away from civilization and its problems. However, it is naive for me to think that these experiences have not been influenced by humankind. I acknowledge that these lands were inhabited by the indigenous people of Canada who were forcibly removed and their history on the lands erased. The areas I have visited are home to many diverse groups of Indigenous peoples who have shared their land under Treaty 6, 7, 8 and the treaties of British Columbia. I honour and acknowledge all of the First Nations, Métis and Inuit peoples who have lived, travelled and gathered on these lands for thousands of years. And still do. As a reminder I have tried to add the indigenous names to these wonderful places<sup>1</sup>. <a href="https://blog.wksu.ml/canada/travel/exclusivity/history/wilderness/2022/08/02/travel-nowadays.html">In another post</a> I explore this complex story further.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The name “Canada” likely comes from the word “kanata,” meaning “village” or “settlement.” In 1535, two indigenous youths told French explorer Jacques Cartier about the route to kanata; they were actually referring to the village of Stadacona, the site of the present-day City of Québec.<sup>2</sup></p>

<p>Mountains, wildlife, turqoise lakes, and beautiful crags is what I had been patiently waiting for since booking my tickets to Edmonton. I was getting more and more excited to head up to the world famous Canadian Rockies. Saturday the 16th of July is when we took a small Communauto packed with camping and climbing gear to go for a 13-day adventure totalling 2354 kilometres. Like a typical romcom cliche, it was love on first sight catching my first glimpse of the mountains from Hinton. Upon arrival it is clear why they are so renowned, you notice a certain wonder in the never-ending mountain chain. However, it is only when you get inside the mountain range that you understand its greatness. The Icefields Parkway from Jasper to Banff is a drive of a lifetime. We then continued west through Yoho National Park, Revelstoke, and Whistler taking Highway 99 to the world-class climbing area of Squamish. Finally ending up in Vancouver to go back to the Netherlands. In this post I will share my climbing experiences with you in these areas.</p>
<p>Everywhere you look, there are these beautiful mountains towering over you. There is a certain greatness to them not only in their aesthetic beauty but also a sheer reminder of the forces of Nature. When entering the domain of the mountains, as you look at them, you can only feel small compared to these giants. Yet, there you are going through them one by one. They evoke the <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Sublime_(philosophy)">sublime</a>, “of greater mysteries and potential beyond the typical”.</p>
<p>Most of the climbing here was only possible because of my good friend Jason who hosted and guided me in these wonderful places!</p>

<section id="national-parcs" class="level1">
<h1>National Parcs</h1>
<p>The Canadian Rockies are home to many gorgeous mountains, snow-white or turquoise lakes, alpine meadows, rivers, and beautiful wildlife. Camping here is a must do to witness the beauty of the mountains up close, just make sure you are protected against mosquitoes and bears. One being more annoying than the other.. Along the Icefields Parkway you are able to witness a numerous amount of wildlife, such as a marmot blocking your hike path, an elk crossing right in front of your hostel or when you drive up to a viewpoint only to be blocked by a black bear at the parking lot. All the viewpoints and hikes are easily accessible: let it be the amazing sunset at Maligne Canyon, the Athabasca &amp; Sunwapta Falls, or the amazing glaciers. The climbing mostly features limestone and quartzite climbing on very good quality walls with beautiful views. There are amazing sport routes all over the place!</p>
<p><strong>Weeping Wall</strong></p>
<p>Between Jasper and Banff you will not be able to count the number of mountains and amazing limestone walls. Right in the middle of these two mountain towns, we started off climbing at Weeping Wall, a wall at the base of Cirrus Mountain. As these walls are covered by waterfalls they are notorious for ice climbing in the winter, however, we decided to climb my first sport route in Canada just next to these falls.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.kevinsu.nl/posts/20220801-canada-climb-adventures/images/WeepingWall.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>After a gruelling Tonquin Valley backpacking trip the days before and a trail run at Parker’s Ridge just a few hours before my excitement beat my fatigue to go up this beautiful wall. The short approach to these walls was a bit of a scramble with a lot of loose rock at the base and unclear pathing but very doable. The wall was of very good quality with amazing lines on them. We decided to do a 35m slab route which brought spectacular views of the falls next to you, a slow moving Athabasca river and a mountain ridge behind you.</p>
<p>The only problem was that the guide book mentioned this route was doable with a 60m rope. Our assumption was that it would be doable as you would have a straight line from the top to the bottom making the route shorter. It was not. We had to rappel and downclimb the last part of the route, while not preferred was doable. Another problem was that after getting the rope up to the middle for the rappel I applied a clove hitch a bit too low, which resulted in uneven strands for the rappel. It was quite a hassle to get them even again. Now I learnt to not trust guide books too much and be conscious about the mark in the middle for a rappel.</p>

<p><strong>Tunnel Mountain (Sacred Buffalo Mountain)</strong></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The contemporary name Tunnel Mountain comes after some surveyors of the Canadian Pacific Railway suggested to create a tunnel through the mountain for their railway, however, it never happened. The Stoney people called it Eyarhey Tatanga Woweyahgey Wakân (Sleeping Buffalo) for a long time, as it looks like one. But as Banff reintroduced wild bison in 2017 they do not consider the mountain to be asleep anymore.<sup>3</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>My first multipitch experience was a mix of the worst and best emotions you can have while climbing. Located near the picturesque town of Banff near the Bow River (Makhabn / river where the bow reeds grow) the climbing side features amazing views of Mount Rundle (Waskahigan Watchi / House mountain), the Bow river and many many more mountain tops. It was spectacular. There is no doubt in my mind that the climber’s high gets tremendously elevated. Every step you take is one further away from the ground, becoming more and more enthralling. While you obviously do the climb with the two of you, you only see each other at the anchor stations. The rest of it? It was 201m of pure climbing on the wall that lets you be alone with yourself.</p>

</div>
<p>The route was graded 5.10a (6a) as Jason led the whole multipitch by himself (!!). I had an amazing experience doing River Run belayed from the top every time. The climb is amazing with a very natural flow to it. The stone was excellent, you cannot wish for better. The lines had a mix of everything, ranging from creative traverses, to slabs to some very hard overhang sections. Having 0 falls and 0 takes I couldn’t be prouder of my climbing in this breathtaking landscape seeing Mount Rundle (Waskahigan Watchi). This part made me say that doing this multipitch was a great choice.</p>
<p>However, there was also a part of me which questioned if it was sensible to do this multipitch without any experience. The route had some very difficult sections and moves in them which wouldn’t make it a 5.10a. My self-doubt and frustration mostly came from belaying and my fight with the many curls and twists in the new 70m rope resulting in short roping. Tensions were high as more and more hours stacked on top of each other. It took 6.5 hours to finish this route. In hindsight, the grigri frustrated more than the benefits of the device. I would not want to repeat this experience on a multipitch again.</p>

<p>The relief and the reward that came standing on top of the sleeping Buffalo was an incredible release of emotions. Crawling from the woods to get on a popular hike trail you are rewarded with a spectacular view of the other side of the mountain. Still full of adrenaline from the climb we managed a small run down the mountain towards the car. :)</p>
<p><strong>The Back of Lake Louise</strong></p>
<p>Lake Louis (Horâ Juthin Îmne / Lake of the Little Fishes) is one of the more popular attractions in the national parcs, with a stunning view of a turquoise lake with its glacier in the background. What attracts me more, after going through the groups of people taking pictures is that there is some spectacular climbing some 15 minutes from the main viewpoint. Open a regional climbing guide and there is no doubt that it features a picture of someone climbing these walls here.</p>
<p>As we are with a crew of three now, we walked through these iconic walls searching for a wall with good cover against the irregular rainfall this day. We started off doing two routes on Blob Rock in which I had the pleasure of leading for the first time: Castle Anthrax (5.9) and The Black Knight (5.10a) around 22 meters. They were reachy and pumpy routes but you are rewarded with good feet for some rest. While being easy in grade, they make up for it by having to find creative solutions to advance the route. It was a beautiful vertical wall made out of some amazing quartzite.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.kevinsu.nl/posts/20220801-canada-climb-adventures/images/LakeLouise1.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Our last route was another creative 5.9 called Fiddler on the Roof on Hillside Wall. It was this amazing airy left-trending arch where if you stayed close to the arch you had nothing under your feet. Looking down to place your feet was scary and fun at the same time! This route was amazing for crossing your feet and switching it up, never knowing where exactly you had to go to get to the next bolt.</p>
<p>For belaying you had to get up a small ledge but the anchor point was far left of this point. As I was the last one on the route I retrieved the quickdraws by pulling the rope to get to the right coming back. Getting each quickdraw increased the swing to the left. As I unclipped the first quickdraw first and then the second quickdraw in one go I forgot to take them out of my rope. This resulted in my belayer and I getting swung to the left. Luckily he caught the swing and only left with some scratches but this could have been bad. I learnt that arches and diagonal clips are very hazardous for the climber and the belayer which require more care and consideration.</p>

<h1>Squamish (Sḵwx̱wú7mesh)</h1>
<p>Squamish is a region renowned for its climbing, with a lot of accessible climbing routes available anywhere. The rock is granite and is simply lovely. We drove there from Banff to Revelstoke onto Highway 99 which was an amazing roadtrip experience. Steep hills and car roads swivelling up the mountain with deep valleys - it is a totally different area than the Rockies but as equally impressive. With a quick stop in Whistler the trip got us pretty hyped to see the climbing areas. Squamish itself and the camps are covered by a lot of forests giving you beautiful views as the light scatters on your tent.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Fun fact: it rains even more than the Netherlands, from October to April - 3 times as much.<sup>4</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Cheakamus Canyon</strong></p>
<p>A whole day full of climbing, all in different locations, yet so accessible and close we got a lot of climbing in. We started off doing another multipitch named Star Check (5.8+), with a high of 85 meters it is not as tall as River Run but the twist here is that a thunderous Cheakamus River is right beneath you when you climb. From the parking lot you hike to the base of the wall, the first anchor point is almost in the water. Not only that, as you climb, you climb on the edge of the wall making the views of some faraway mountains constantly visible during the climb. While the rope did coil a little bit, it was not as bad as before making belaying way more enjoyable. The wall gives you a lot of playtime how you go up, whereas I went more on the edge you can also do a more slabby approach on the face.</p>
<p>A quote I read in Johnston Canyon from Walter J. Phillips: &gt; “Water is the most expressive emotion in nature. It responds to every mood from tranquillity to turbulence”.</p>
<p>Listening to the water and <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/EVfLWfbSejtUapcu9">watching it ravage beneath</a> you is an experience I will not soon forget.</p>

<p><strong>Shannon Falls (Kwékwetxwm)</strong></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Kwékwetxwm is the Squamish name for this breathtaking waterfall known for the deep rumbling sound of its cascading torrents. Kwékwetxwm is a highly used resource gathering area because of its proximity to the nearby village of Stawamus. This was a prominent deer and raccoon hunting area. The mythological hero Xwéch’taal (the serpent slayer) used this as an access route in his pursuit of Sínulhka, the dreaded double headed sea serpent. The path of Sínulhka reeked of spiritual power necessitating Xwech’taal to find a parallel path then the serpent climbed Siám’ Smánit (the Chief Mountain). He purified himself in the waters of Kwékwetxwm to strengthen his mind, body and soul. (December 2011 from: Cultural Journey Sea-to-Sky Corridor website, Squamish and Lil’wat First Nations)<sup>5</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>From there we continued to another location, aptly named Shannon Falls. However, this time we could not see it but only hear the fall as we went up to the very slabby AMO wall. Without a guide book of this area it became more difficult to determine what routes and grades we were actually doing. So get a guide book! And as a tip, you might even find the book in a secondhand bookstore nearby (we did but decided not to buy it..). What we did know, was that it would be a good opportunity for me to lead my first multipitch climb. On Mountain Project it had a nice easy route but it was difficult to find it. I led one route, however, it did not continue further than those anchors which was only visible once you reached the top. For experience I belayed from the top anyways and we then rappelled down.</p>
<p>While we both did not like slab routes we continued on. The sun was baking us and our rubber shoes onto the wall making the slab climbs even harder. Being out of your comfort zone is how you grow right? This route was one of the hardest slab routes I have tried, there were almost no good foot holds and rests. For many of the sections there were very bad hand holds forcing you to trust your feet and stand up on practically nothing. Leading this route was very challenging and it took a lot of endurance out of me, yet it was a big step for me how to lead scary routes. After doing the first pitch we decided to cancel and rappel down due to time constraints.</p>

<p><strong>Juniper Point</strong></p>
<p>Getting here at sunset while meeting our third climber (who brought food for us!) was probably the best end of this climbing day. This is only 40 minutes away from Vancouver with the ability of cliffside climbing and good anchors for toproping. It is simply a stunning place to climb as the red sun glow hits the islands in the background, while you climb above the Pacific Ocean. It features a mix of easy and hard routes with the hardest one we did being a 5.10b/c on some beautiful overhang walls.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.kevinsu.nl/posts/20220801-canada-climb-adventures/images/JuniperPoint.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>We continued to climb in the dark with headlamps, which created amazing conditions for climbing in a flow as you have to go step by step. The solitude and the darkness creates an even more intimate experience on the wall. Learning moment: just make sure when you do this to know the way back in the dark and check if any gates close after certain hours!</p>

<p><strong>Murrin’s Park</strong></p>
<p>This is the last climbing spot before I head back to the lowlands. And what a place to end it on. So many crags. So so many. There are even official signs showing you the way to the walls. In the heatwave this place was an absolute life saver with its many trees giving us cover and a beautiful lake to swim in. We first went onto Milkman’s Wall on the route Jugs, Not Drugs (5.8) is a classic according to the internet and gave us a nice warm up. Giving me a good catch phrase for further use too. We then continued to Genesis wall which had a beautiful diagonal crack line in it called Original Thin (5.10c). My most difficult climb in Canada with a lot of compression moves but every move felt beautiful. A ton of opportunity for heel hooks, good underclings, and crimpy side pulls force you to climb in a technical way.</p>
<p>We then moved on to Pet(trifying) Wall a bit further than where we started. When you get there, you immediately know this wall is a special one as you cannot see both ends at the same time. We struggled a bit with finding the right routes as we did not have a climbing guide book so vague statements online is what we had to deal with. This is definitely not recommended as you don’t know what you climb! There are a lot of 5.11+ and 5.12+ routes here but we managed to get the right routes in the end. Once on the wall everything seemed to click. Route finding was still a bit tricky as I had to traverse numerous times because I chose the wrong direction but it is beautiful to climb on Heavy Petting Action (5.10b). It had everything: great flakes, good ledges, a tricky roof section but also a chimney section at the end. It did seem the route would never stop as I got more and more tired but with its 27 meters it was still fairly doable.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.kevinsu.nl/posts/20220801-canada-climb-adventures/images/PetWall.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>A nice swim in Browning Lake on this heat summer day was an amazing reward after the climb!</p>

<section id="the-end" class="level1">
<h1>The End</h1>
<p>To sum it up, the climbing in Canada is incredible. I feel like I have written this 7 times over using slightly different phrasing in this article. That alone would have made it worthwhile to go but when you combine it with everything else (another blog post, soon!) it becomes an incredible adventure. Quick ten minute adventures here are full experiences. And they are worth pursuing.</p>
<p>It has not been often that my vacation was so much focused on climbing. I believe climbing lets you experience nature in a totally different way. That small time when you are on the wall battling to get higher surrounded by wilderness is special. The wilderness and climbing lets you be alone with yourself, so you are able to find yourself. But do not underestimate the hard work that goes into it. Jason quoted to me “Earn your turns” famous in skiitouring referring to the hard work that goes into getting to the top to ski down. The same mantra can be applied to climbing, you earn all the beautiful viewpoints, hikes, food, and rests when you finish a hard climb. Which makes me enjoy everything a little bit more.</p>
<p>I have added the learning moments to showcase the dangers and risks of climbing outdoors. They are my constant reminder to remain vigilant in order to be as safe as possible for me and my friends. My experience in Canada reflected on my relative inexperience in climbing outdoors which tells me to take it even more slow and cautious. <img src="https://blog.kevinsu.nl/posts/20220801-canada-climb-adventures/images/trailrun_start.jpg" class="img-fluid quarto-figure quarto-figure-right" style="width:80.0%"></p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>There are many reasons to write a blog but I will detail mine. Writing has always been a sore spot of mine. Simply put, I am not very good at writing, and I struggle with the process. It could always be a little bit better. But I decided this negative association doesn’t have to be there forever in my life. There are many positives to gain from constructing loose thoughts into concise texts. Next to it being an outlet for creativity I also want to work on how to communicate my thoughts better. The Sense of Style by Steven Pinker has given me a lot of practical tips and I wish to practice them in the near future.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The other reason is my opinion on our contemporary digital landscape. The digital revolution led to the rise of social media which allows us to connect with others. I do believe you can use social media for good, connecting with people and as a information hub. Yet, I am resistant towards the corporations behind the technology. Often they focus on our narcissistic tendencies to compare ourselves to others, reinforce our competitive mind, or non-organically influencing our thoughts harming true connection. I find it difficult to break the systematic tendencies of these companies, which is why I prefer the clean, long-form content without <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/system/files/2022-03/edpb_03-2022_guidelines_on_dark_patterns_in_social_media_platform_interfaces_en.pdf">deceptive patterns</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>My skepticisms has only grown stronger the last few years. This following essay details the harmful impact of recommendation systems, which is written with a friend of mine. It gives an understanding to the addictive tendencies behind current day social media. To summarize, the incentives of the technology companies are wrongly aligned with what is good for me and society. Their aim is to get your attention span and keep it, using whatever means possible in order to profit off your data. In this system, aptly named <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Surveillance_capitalism">surveillance capitalism</a>.</p>

<p>Ironically, a year after Netflix aired <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/The_Social_Dilemma">The Social Dilemma</a> featuring similar arguments. Another must read on this topic that shaped my reluctance towards sharing your data without owning them is the book <a href="https://decorrespondent.nl/nietsteverbergen">Je hebt wél iets te verbergen</a>.

<h1>YouTube’s recommender algorithm; the friend we did not ask for</h1>

<section id="introduction" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The Master of Science Engineering and Policy Analysis (EPA) has one word in the vocabulary of every student: EPA-life. A term for when your mind can only think of the unsolvable, complex, international problems we face. Working tirelessly every day my mind was keen on distraction. There was no lack of options either: Netflix, Facebook, and YouTube all offered much-needed relaxation. Ultimately, YouTube was the more convincing offer. I would work in the Hague until 6 p.m., take the tram home and then, together with over 30 million others worldwide, watch YouTube videos to relax. After searching for “chess” and observing Magnus Carlsen pull off a wonderful win using the Sicilian defense, something peculiar happened.</p>
<p>A video played, showing cheaters in the world of chess. After clicking back to a memorable game between Ajax and Real Madrid, YouTube took me towards videos on bribery. Outlandish claims became more present the further I went. The pattern continued as I searched for more topics, always leading me to more extremist videos on the topic I had initially searched for. Documentaries on the second world war led to holocaust denial videos, speeches by American presidents led to smear campaigns. YouTube’s autoplay function and the recommendation system drew my curiosity.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-influence-of-youtubes-recommendation-algorithm" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-influence-of-youtubes-recommendation-algorithm">The Influence of YouTube’s Recommendation Algorithm</h2>
<p>It used to be that my friends would advise me what to watch, now YouTube seems to have replaced them. In return we do not need to spend any effort finding the next video that will get our minds of things. Using smart personalized suggestions, based on the enormous amount of data Alphabet Inc (owner of YouTube and Google services) owns, they know what makes you click. The recommender system keeps people interested and glued to the screen. The system recommends around 70% of the videos watched by users; the influence of YouTube is unavoidable. But why does this algorithm drive us to extremist content, with no intention from our side?</p>
<p>To answer that question, we need to inspect YouTube’s business model. As a platform, it brings together content creators and content viewers. YouTube makes money by brokering fitting advertisements to users. To optimize this process, their goal is to maximize the time spent on YouTube. This has not gone unnoticed by Reed Hastings, CEO of Netflix. During the earnings call he said: “Netflix’s biggest competitors are YouTube, Facebook, and sleep”. The attention economy views time as a scarce resource, if you spend time on one thing, it means a loss of time for something else. In the past, the market focused on getting money, nowadays, this fight is about time spent. More time on a platform means more advertisements, thus increasing YouTube’s share of the pie. This effect also takes place on YouTube itself, as they pay content creators proportional to the number of views they get on their videos, which again incentivizes to maximize the time spent by the users.</p>
</section>
<section id="human-characteristics-exploited-by-youtube" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="human-characteristics-exploited-by-youtube">Human Characteristics Exploited by YouTube</h2>
<p>To maximize this time, YouTube makes use of different human characteristics. First, people spend time on content out of the ordinary. Think of the number of movies or books about a regular person going to his regular job every day: The Godfather does not manage a supermarket, Batman and the Joker do not run a restaurant, and Frodo does not bring back a book to the library. Deep love dramas, heavy war stories, and extreme conspiracy theories attract people. This is no different when watching a YouTube video on the couch, where clickbait titles and extremist videos are just one click away.</p>
<p>What makes things even worse is the human nature of curiosity. YouTube speaks to our core instincts by showing the tip of the iceberg, often in the shape of an interesting-looking clickbait title. Combined with the human skill of habituation YouTube’s influence increases. As with any addiction, for the first time only a small portion is enough, but as time passes, the portion has to increase more and more to keep us satisfied. Zeynep Tüfekçi, writer and academic on the social impact of technology, explained YouTube’s algorithm with the following example: a restaurant that continuously loads our plates up with sugary and fatty foods, in turn we keep wanting more. As time passes, the videos get more and more extremist.</p>
<p>Another human characteristic is the sheep-like behaviour of watching videos others have watched. This effect means the most extremist videos get watched and recommended repeatedly at an increasing speed. If all this was not enough, most of the views on extremist videos come from a small group of heavy users. This is like recommending a diet based on regular customers of a fast-food chain. Guillaume Chaslot, a former employee of YouTube, claimed the effect of sheep-like behaviour and heavy users increase extremists videos.</p>
<p>So part of the large availability of extremist content is inherent to the business model of YouTube. However, a second reason for the presence of extremist videos is the existence of ideological attackers. Ironically enough, YouTuber “Smarter every day”, showed a series of computer made videos, that somehow pierced through the defence mechanisms of the video platform. In combination with today’s ability to buy fake followers and subscribers to watch your videos, it is relatively easy to get your computer made extremist videos on the autoplay lists of over 30 million people every day.</p>
<p>Not all parts of the recommendation are troublesome. Every day, people get recommended videos they love: new music videos, interesting chess games, highlights of a great football match. It is convenient and saves a lot of time, which is scarce in today’s society. However, are we aware of the price we pay for convenience? It is unclear how YouTube’s black box of recommendation works, despite having a huge impact on society. It is about time that the 30 million extremist content addicted people should rehabilitate.</p>
</section>
<section id="youtubes-role-and-responsibility" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="youtubes-role-and-responsibility">YouTube’s Role and Responsibility</h2>
<p>Is YouTube responsible for our human nature to keep digging for more? Is it the viewers responsibility to understand that they are being influenced and prevent the effect? YouTube claims they are only a facilitating medium showing us the videos we want to see. There is a certain truth to that, of course we do not have to watch the recommended videos. We still have a choice. However, how informed is this choice? These corporations are driven by money to keep our attention on a platform. To do so, they have removed a big barrier: deciding what to watch. Imagine if you had to think yourself what to watch every night; indeed, you would be inclined to move on to something more convenient. In essence, corporations nowadays have fulfilled this decision of what we spent our time on for us. Though, looking at it that way, it is similar to voting for the national elections where someone has already filled in a choice for you, without explaining how they arrived at this conclusion. You could still erase that choice but convenience dictates that the majority will leave it there. Even though YouTube has “only” a facilitating role, their influence is significant to say the least. YouTube possesses the power to decide what users watch.</p>
<p>Users however, cannot get a grasp on what YouTube is actually doing to recommend videos. Since the introduction of their personalized recommendations with a deep neural network they have tweaked and changed the algorithm behind closed curtains. There is no way to know for certain what they actually did, as they will never reveal it voluntarily. It is in their best interest to find the ‘best’ algorithm to keep viewers attracted to their platform, in order to outrun competition. However, when the curtain gets lifted, it does not look good. In an interview with Bloomberg, it is stated that many engineers at YouTube claimed that the leaders were not interested in removing extremist videos or conspiracies. Yonatan Zunger, privacy engineer at the time of the introduction of the neural network algorithm, mentioned that he had a solution in place for videos close to breaching the community guidelines, allow them on the platform but do not recommend them, which was promptly rejected. Leadership only had one goal, which was getting more engagement from users: don’t rock the boat.</p>
<p>The adjustments that YouTube did reveal under the pressure of the media are a disappointment.</p>
<p>The survivors of the Parkland shooting event of 2018, where tragically seventeen people died, were met with online harassment. Conspiracy theories claiming that the event was not real were trending on social media, including YouTube. The YouTube recommender system kept promoting these conspiracy videos to the top. As these videos were often the first videos users would see when searching for the shooting, it shaped the minds of many people.</p>
<p>The danger lies in the ease of how a wrong message gets spread without the proper authority or sources to back the claims in this message. To combat this example of actively sharing wrong information, YouTube publicly announced they would add information from Wikimedia to inform people watching conspiracy videos. Worryingly, this only changes the narrative of YouTube’s responsibility. Instead of making sure that these harmful videos do not have a (active) place on their platform, they shift the burden to Wikipedia to make sure accurate information is placed. The head of Wikipedia’s public relations department, Katherine Maher, had some reservations. While Wikipedia is quite accurate, it relies on crowdsourcing and contributions of volunteers. According to Maher people need to be critical and check the sources which they simply ‘can’t do in a simple search result’, like in the case of the Parkland shooting.</p>
<p>Not only Wikipedia articles will be included, but also ‘authoritative’ news will be included. YouTube then holds the power which news source will be published and deemed the authoritative source on the matter. The foundation of this algorithm also has significant flaws. The Washington Post revealed that the top news link for final election results led to a news site with false numbers. Attention to media bias has risen with polarized elections throughout the world. YouTube therefore now holds even more power by deciding which news articles to promote. The dangers of the recommender system do not only lie in extremist or conspiracy videos. Through recommendations a pedophile network was set up not long ago. These pedophiles would look at videos of children showing genitals, while the comments were full of time-stamps of these events. The algorithm did exactly what it was set out to do: find videos that kept this kind of users engaged. Driven by previous traffic these recommendations were fuelled by other pedophiles. A problem that YouTube has faced since 2017, still ongoing with no end in sight. When this controversy came up, prominent advertisers were very clear that they would pull out of YouTube if it was not fixed soon. YouTube’s solution? They removed accounts of the pedophiles, demonetized videos, and disabled the comment sections. This is YouTube playing whack-a-mole without changing structural incentives. YouTuber Matt Stone who highlighted these practices in 2019 in his video describes this as an ‘algorithmic wormhole’ that can be found in mere seconds.</p>
<p>Another mole that got whacked are the clickbait titles, with harmful content that got recommended often by YouTube’s algorithms. In their official blog, the YouTube team shared their solution of recommending based on likes and dislikes rather than the number of views, in order to reduce the presence of clickbait. However, remembering the opportunity to buy fake subscribers, which can like fake news videos computer-based, this change in the algorithms is not worth a penny.</p>
<p>In their latest update, the YouTube team mentions the reduction in recommendations of harmful videos, that come close to the line of the Community Guidelines, such as videos claiming the earth is flat, or false claims on historic events like 9/11 or the holocaust. However, YouTube is only working on reducing the presence of these videos in the recommendations overall. This means the videos will still be available on the platform, and can still be reached when users are on track towards those subjects. In fact, the only change that happens is the length of the road towards extremist videos. Keeping in mind the comparison to a restaurant where only sugary fat meals are served over and over again, this measure will not have any effect in the long run.</p>
<p>What the stated examples have in common, is the symbolic nature. It seems that YouTube only takes symbolic measures to fix the noticeable symptoms, by doing just enough to spin the media narrative and to keep regulators happy, however, the company never touches the root cause of the problem.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="proposed-scheme-for-improvements">Proposed Scheme for Improvements</h2>
<p>As YouTube operates in an electronic global environment that crosses borders, it is impossible to find a one-size-fits-all solution to the negative impact the recommender systems have on society. YouTube can be seen as a natural monopoly as a video platform, which means they hold all the power. Next to that, the many values involved, such as freedom of speech, democratic sovereignty and censorship, make it hard to keep all parties happy. So instead of searching for the policy that will fix the world, we propose a scheme of improvements to the system.</p>
<p>The first part of this scheme is to bring back old friends into the recommendation system in addition to YouTube’s recommendations. Making use of the friend system in YouTube, users can recommend videos to each other, which will be automatically added to the autoplaylist of the friends selected by the sharer. When all the videos recommended by a user’s friends are watched, the system returns to its current state of using YouTube’s recommended videos. As this function will be used more over time, the time spent on YouTube will exist for a bigger part of videos recommended by friends. A big impact this will make is the effect of social norms feeding into the recommendations.</p>
<p>The solution is, however, not perfect. Firstly, it is likely that there will be ‘influencers’ with an enormous amount of friends recommending videos. Secondly, it is very easy to get stuck in filter bubbles as well, only this time together with your friends. However, there is a shift of power from YouTube back to society. Whenever you get a video recommended you know it is from someone you are familiar with instead of a corporate entity. At the same time, the business model of YouTube does not have to change a single bit, but could even result in better user satisfaction.</p>
<p>The second part of the scheme incorporates society as a whole. Kevin Roose, a columnist for Business and a writer-at-large for The New York Times, talks of “deprogramming a generation” as a necessity to change the impact of platforms like YouTube. This part focuses on giving the people the tools to examine sources critically. YouTube is not just a place to find entertainment, but as was found by Pearson Education, over 50% of youngsters reaches out to YouTube as an information source. The platform should be seen as the library of the now. It is therefore important to inform the users which of the “books” can be seen as reliable, useful and trustworthy, just like it is taught in schools for books or internet websites. This collaborative effort between the government and YouTube should start in school but also on YouTube itself. This way the minds of the users will be changed, and harmful videos will be evaded. Specifically, an informative video could be created that explains how to interact with the different kinds of videos on YouTube.</p>
<p>The third and last part of our scheme that will shrink the negative impact of YouTube is to make the platform responsible for the videos they recommend. This would mean slightly pulling YouTube out of its facilitating role, causing them to be more involved with the content displayed on their platform. A legal framework should be created indicating the responsibility of YouTube and the changes the platform should make in order to recommend only the fruitful videos to users. This responsibility would at least remove the fake news videos that have been duplicated multiple times and viewed/liked by fake subscribers. If YouTube would be responsible for the videos they recommend, these types of fake, harming videos would not have a place in the auto playlists any longer. It is important to stress that this part of the scheme does not influence the freedom of speech value, as every legal video will stay available on the platform. No censorship takes place in what can be uploaded, recommendations will only become more thoughtful.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The scheme sketched above can be seen as the way society started to deal with cigarettes not that long ago. Friends would not recommend cigarettes to each other, due to the social norms that exist. Of course smokers would recommend them, but this is inevitable. Likewise, extremist people are always going to find their way into extremist videos, and will recommend them to their friends as well. However, adding social norms to the system will decrease the overall use of the undesirable product. The education part of the scheme can also be seen in the use of cigarettes. Parents teach their children that smoking is bad, schools teach their students the same thing. By creating an appealing video that explains the dangers of extremist videos, but also shows how to interact with them, people will learn to evade such videos. Lastly, like society stopped the promotion of cigarettes, in the future the responsible YouTube will stop promoting (recommending) extremist videos completely. The scheme is a first step in regulating the influence of YouTube on our daily lives. When the walk is continued, YouTube will be a safe environment for relaxing distraction. It will not settle all the problems that YouTube’s algorithms inhabit, but at least we will be able to watch our daily chess videos peacefully.</p>
