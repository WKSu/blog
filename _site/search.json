    "text": "Introduction\nThe Master of Science Engineering and Policy Analysis (EPA) has one word in the vocabulary of every student: EPA-life. A term for when your mind can only think of the unsolvable, complex, international problems we face. Working tirelessly every day my mind was keen on distraction. There was no lack of options either: Netflix, Facebook, and YouTube all offered much-needed relaxation. Ultimately, YouTube was the more convincing offer. I would work in the Hague until 6 p.m., take the tram home and then, together with over 30 million others worldwide, watch YouTube videos to relax. After searching for “chess” and observing Magnus Carlsen pull off a wonderful win using the Sicilian defense, something peculiar happened.\nA video played, showing cheaters in the world of chess. After clicking back to a memorable game between Ajax and Real Madrid, YouTube took me towards videos on bribery. Outlandish claims became more present the further I went. The pattern continued as I searched for more topics, always leading me to more extremist videos on the topic I had initially searched for. Documentaries on the second world war led to holocaust denial videos, speeches by American presidents led to smear campaigns. YouTube’s autoplay function and the recommendation system drew my curiosity."

    "text": "The Influence of YouTube’s Recommendation Algorithm\nIt used to be that my friends would advise me what to watch, now YouTube seems to have replaced them. In return we do not need to spend any effort finding the next video that will get our minds of things. Using smart personalized suggestions, based on the enormous amount of data Alphabet Inc (owner of YouTube and Google services) owns, they know what makes you click. The recommender system keeps people interested and glued to the screen. The system recommends around 70% of the videos watched by users; the influence of YouTube is unavoidable. But why does this algorithm drive us to extremist content, with no intention from our side?\nTo answer that question, we need to inspect YouTube’s business model. As a platform, it brings together content creators and content viewers. YouTube makes money by brokering fitting advertisements to users. To optimize this process, their goal is to maximize the time spent on YouTube. This has not gone unnoticed by Reed Hastings, CEO of Netflix. During the earnings call he said: “Netflix’s biggest competitors are YouTube, Facebook, and sleep”. The attention economy views time as a scarce resource, if you spend time on one thing, it means a loss of time for something else. In the past, the market focused on getting money, nowadays, this fight is about time spent. More time on a platform means more advertisements, thus increasing YouTube’s share of the pie. This effect also takes place on YouTube itself, as they pay content creators proportional to the number of views they get on their videos, which again incentivizes to maximize the time spent by the users."

    "section": "Human Characteristics Exploited by YouTube",
    "text": "Human Characteristics Exploited by YouTube\nTo maximize this time, YouTube makes use of different human characteristics. First, people spend time on content out of the ordinary. Think of the number of movies or books about a regular person going to his regular job every day: The Godfather does not manage a supermarket, Batman and the Joker do not run a restaurant, and Frodo does not bring back a book to the library. Deep love dramas, heavy war stories, and extreme conspiracy theories attract people. This is no different when watching a YouTube video on the couch, where clickbait titles and extremist videos are just one click away.\nWhat makes things even worse is the human nature of curiosity. YouTube speaks to our core instincts by showing the tip of the iceberg, often in the shape of an interesting-looking clickbait title. Combined with the human skill of habituation YouTube’s influence increases. As with any addiction, for the first time only a small portion is enough, but as time passes, the portion has to increase more and more to keep us satisfied. Zeynep Tüfekçi, writer and academic on the social impact of technology, explained YouTube’s algorithm with the following example: a restaurant that continuously loads our plates up with sugary and fatty foods, in turn we keep wanting more. As time passes, the videos get more and more extremist.\nAnother human characteristic is the sheep-like behaviour of watching videos others have watched. This effect means the most extremist videos get watched and recommended repeatedly at an increasing speed. If all this was not enough, most of the views on extremist videos come from a small group of heavy users. This is like recommending a diet based on regular customers of a fast-food chain. Guillaume Chaslot, a former employee of YouTube, claimed the effect of sheep-like behaviour and heavy users increase extremists videos.\nSo part of the large availability of extremist content is inherent to the business model of YouTube. However, a second reason for the presence of extremist videos is the existence of ideological attackers. Ironically enough, YouTuber “Smarter every day”, showed a series of computer made videos, that somehow pierced through the defence mechanisms of the video platform. In combination with today’s ability to buy fake followers and subscribers to watch your videos, it is relatively easy to get your computer made extremist videos on the autoplay lists of over 30 million people every day.\nNot all parts of the recommendation are troublesome. Every day, people get recommended videos they love: new music videos, interesting chess games, highlights of a great football match. It is convenient and saves a lot of time, which is scarce in today’s society. However, are we aware of the price we pay for convenience? It is unclear how YouTube’s black box of recommendation works, despite having a huge impact on society. It is about time that the 30 million extremist content addicted people should rehabilitate."

    "section": "YouTube’s Role and Responsibility",
    "text": "YouTube’s Role and Responsibility\nIs YouTube responsible for our human nature to keep digging for more? Is it the viewers responsibility to understand that they are being influenced and prevent the effect? YouTube claims they are only a facilitating medium showing us the videos we want to see. There is a certain truth to that, of course we do not have to watch the recommended videos. We still have a choice. However, how informed is this choice? These corporations are driven by money to keep our attention on a platform. To do so, they have removed a big barrier: deciding what to watch. Imagine if you had to think yourself what to watch every night; indeed, you would be inclined to move on to something more convenient. In essence, corporations nowadays have fulfilled this decision of what we spent our time on for us. Though, looking at it that way, it is similar to voting for the national elections where someone has already filled in a choice for you, without explaining how they arrived at this conclusion. You could still erase that choice but convenience dictates that the majority will leave it there. Even though YouTube has “only” a facilitating role, their influence is significant to say the least. YouTube possesses the power to decide what users watch.\nUsers however, cannot get a grasp on what YouTube is actually doing to recommend videos. Since the introduction of their personalized recommendations with a deep neural network they have tweaked and changed the algorithm behind closed curtains. There is no way to know for certain what they actually did, as they will never reveal it voluntarily. It is in their best interest to find the ‘best’ algorithm to keep viewers attracted to their platform, in order to outrun competition. However, when the curtain gets lifted, it does not look good. In an interview with Bloomberg, it is stated that many engineers at YouTube claimed that the leaders were not interested in removing extremist videos or conspiracies. Yonatan Zunger, privacy engineer at the time of the introduction of the neural network algorithm, mentioned that he had a solution in place for videos close to breaching the community guidelines, allow them on the platform but do not recommend them, which was promptly rejected. Leadership only had one goal, which was getting more engagement from users: don’t rock the boat.\nThe adjustments that YouTube did reveal under the pressure of the media are a disappointment.\nThe survivors of the Parkland shooting event of 2018, where tragically seventeen people died, were met with online harassment. Conspiracy theories claiming that the event was not real were trending on social media, including YouTube. The YouTube recommender system kept promoting these conspiracy videos to the top. As these videos were often the first videos users would see when searching for the shooting, it shaped the minds of many people.\nThe danger lies in the ease of how a wrong message gets spread without the proper authority or sources to back the claims in this message. To combat this example of actively sharing wrong information, YouTube publicly announced they would add information from Wikimedia to inform people watching conspiracy videos. Worryingly, this only changes the narrative of YouTube’s responsibility. Instead of making sure that these harmful videos do not have a (active) place on their platform, they shift the burden to Wikipedia to make sure accurate information is placed. The head of Wikipedia’s public relations department, Katherine Maher, had some reservations. While Wikipedia is quite accurate, it relies on crowdsourcing and contributions of volunteers. According to Maher people need to be critical and check the sources which they simply ‘can’t do in a simple search result’, like in the case of the Parkland shooting.\nNot only Wikipedia articles will be included, but also ‘authoritative’ news will be included. YouTube then holds the power which news source will be published and deemed the authoritative source on the matter. The foundation of this algorithm also has significant flaws. The Washington Post revealed that the top news link for final election results led to a news site with false numbers. Attention to media bias has risen with polarized elections throughout the world. YouTube therefore now holds even more power by deciding which news articles to promote. The dangers of the recommender system do not only lie in extremist or conspiracy videos. Through recommendations a pedophile network was set up not long ago. These pedophiles would look at videos of children showing genitals, while the comments were full of time-stamps of these events. The algorithm did exactly what it was set out to do: find videos that kept this kind of users engaged. Driven by previous traffic these recommendations were fuelled by other pedophiles. A problem that YouTube has faced since 2017, still ongoing with no end in sight. When this controversy came up, prominent advertisers were very clear that they would pull out of YouTube if it was not fixed soon. YouTube’s solution? They removed accounts of the pedophiles, demonetized videos, and disabled the comment sections. This is YouTube playing whack-a-mole without changing structural incentives. YouTuber Matt Stone who highlighted these practices in 2019 in his video describes this as an ‘algorithmic wormhole’ that can be found in mere seconds.\nAnother mole that got whacked are the clickbait titles, with harmful content that got recommended often by YouTube’s algorithms. In their official blog, the YouTube team shared their solution of recommending based on likes and dislikes rather than the number of views, in order to reduce the presence of clickbait. However, remembering the opportunity to buy fake subscribers, which can like fake news videos computer-based, this change in the algorithms is not worth a penny.\nIn their latest update, the YouTube team mentions the reduction in recommendations of harmful videos, that come close to the line of the Community Guidelines, such as videos claiming the earth is flat, or false claims on historic events like 9/11 or the holocaust. However, YouTube is only working on reducing the presence of these videos in the recommendations overall. This means the videos will still be available on the platform, and can still be reached when users are on track towards those subjects. In fact, the only change that happens is the length of the road towards extremist videos. Keeping in mind the comparison to a restaurant where only sugary fat meals are served over and over again, this measure will not have any effect in the long run.\nWhat the stated examples have in common, is the symbolic nature. It seems that YouTube only takes symbolic measures to fix the noticeable symptoms, by doing just enough to spin the media narrative and to keep regulators happy, however, the company never touches the root cause of the problem."

    "section": "Proposed Scheme for Improvements",
    "text": "Proposed Scheme for Improvements\nAs YouTube operates in an electronic global environment that crosses borders, it is impossible to find a one-size-fits-all solution to the negative impact the recommender systems have on society. YouTube can be seen as a natural monopoly as a video platform, which means they hold all the power. Next to that, the many values involved, such as freedom of speech, democratic sovereignty and censorship, make it hard to keep all parties happy. So instead of searching for the policy that will fix the world, we propose a scheme of improvements to the system.\nThe first part of this scheme is to bring back old friends into the recommendation system in addition to YouTube’s recommendations. Making use of the friend system in YouTube, users can recommend videos to each other, which will be automatically added to the autoplaylist of the friends selected by the sharer. When all the videos recommended by a user’s friends are watched, the system returns to its current state of using YouTube’s recommended videos. As this function will be used more over time, the time spent on YouTube will exist for a bigger part of videos recommended by friends. A big impact this will make is the effect of social norms feeding into the recommendations.\nThe solution is, however, not perfect. Firstly, it is likely that there will be ‘influencers’ with an enormous amount of friends recommending videos. Secondly, it is very easy to get stuck in filter bubbles as well, only this time together with your friends. However, there is a shift of power from YouTube back to society. Whenever you get a video recommended you know it is from someone you are familiar with instead of a corporate entity. At the same time, the business model of YouTube does not have to change a single bit, but could even result in better user satisfaction.\nThe second part of the scheme incorporates society as a whole. Kevin Roose, a columnist for Business and a writer-at-large for The New York Times, talks of “deprogramming a generation” as a necessity to change the impact of platforms like YouTube. This part focuses on giving the people the tools to examine sources critically. YouTube is not just a place to find entertainment, but as was found by Pearson Education, over 50% of youngsters reaches out to YouTube as an information source. The platform should be seen as the library of the now. It is therefore important to inform the users which of the “books” can be seen as reliable, useful and trustworthy, just like it is taught in schools for books or internet websites. This collaborative effort between the government and YouTube should start in school but also on YouTube itself. This way the minds of the users will be changed, and harmful videos will be evaded. Specifically, an informative video could be created that explains how to interact with the different kinds of videos on YouTube.\nThe third and last part of our scheme that will shrink the negative impact of YouTube is to make the platform responsible for the videos they recommend. This would mean slightly pulling YouTube out of its facilitating role, causing them to be more involved with the content displayed on their platform. A legal framework should be created indicating the responsibility of YouTube and the changes the platform should make in order to recommend only the fruitful videos to users. This responsibility would at least remove the fake news videos that have been duplicated multiple times and viewed/liked by fake subscribers. If YouTube would be responsible for the videos they recommend, these types of fake, harming videos would not have a place in the auto playlists any longer. It is important to stress that this part of the scheme does not influence the freedom of speech value, as every legal video will stay available on the platform. No censorship takes place in what can be uploaded, recommendations will only become more thoughtful."

    "section": "Conclusion",
    "text": "Conclusion\nThe scheme sketched above can be seen as the way society started to deal with cigarettes not that long ago. Friends would not recommend cigarettes to each other, due to the social norms that exist. Of course smokers would recommend them, but this is inevitable. Likewise, extremist people are always going to find their way into extremist videos, and will recommend them to their friends as well. However, adding social norms to the system will decrease the overall use of the undesirable product. The education part of the scheme can also be seen in the use of cigarettes. Parents teach their children that smoking is bad, schools teach their students the same thing. By creating an appealing video that explains the dangers of extremist videos, but also shows how to interact with them, people will learn to evade such videos. Lastly, like society stopped the promotion of cigarettes, in the future the responsible YouTube will stop promoting (recommending) extremist videos completely. The scheme is a first step in regulating the influence of YouTube on our daily lives. When the walk is continued, YouTube will be a safe environment for relaxing distraction. It will not settle all the problems that YouTube’s algorithms inhabit, but at least we will be able to watch our daily chess videos peacefully."

    "text": "By going into nature, I am trying to get away from civilization and its problems. However, it is naive for me to think that these experiences have not been influenced by humankind. I acknowledge that these lands were inhabited by the indigenous people of Canada who were forcibly removed and their history on the lands erased. The areas I have visited are home to many diverse groups of Indigenous peoples who have shared their land under Treaty 6, 7, 8 and the treaties of British Columbia. I honour and acknowledge all of the First Nations, Métis and Inuit peoples who have lived, travelled and gathered on these lands for thousands of years. And still do. As a reminder I have tried to add the indigenous names to these wonderful places1. In another post I explore this complex story further.\n\n\nThe name “Canada” likely comes from the word “kanata,” meaning “village” or “settlement.” In 1535, two indigenous youths told French explorer Jacques Cartier about the route to kanata; they were actually referring to the village of Stadacona, the site of the present-day City of Québec.2\n\n\nMountains, wildlife, turqoise lakes, and beautiful crags is what I had been patiently waiting for since booking my tickets to Edmonton. I was getting more and more excited to head up to the world famous Canadian Rockies. Saturday the 16th of July is when we took a small Communauto packed with camping and climbing gear to go for a 13-day adventure totalling 2354 kilometres. Like a typical romcom cliche, it was love on first sight catching my first glimpse of the mountains from Hinton. Upon arrival it is clear why they are so renowned, you notice a certain wonder in the never-ending mountain chain. However, it is only when you get inside the mountain range that you understand its greatness. The Icefields Parkway from Jasper to Banff is a drive of a lifetime. We then continued west through Yoho National Park, Revelstoke, and Whistler taking Highway 99 to the world-class climbing area of Squamish. Finally ending up in Vancouver to go back to the Netherlands. In this post I will share my climbing experiences with you in these areas.\nEverywhere you look, there are these beautiful mountains towering over you. There is a certain greatness to them not only in their aesthetic beauty but also a sheer reminder of the forces of Nature. When entering the domain of the mountains, as you look at them, you can only feel small compared to these giants. Yet, there you are going through them one by one. They evoke the sublime, “of greater mysteries and potential beyond the typical”.\nMost of the climbing here was only possible because of my good friend Jason who hosted and guided me in these wonderful places!\n Gorgeous, gorgeous mountains"

    "text": "After spending time this year in Andalusia exploring the gorgeous mountains, learning about the historic period of Al-Andalus, and admiring beautiful architectural wonders it made me wonder what exactly it is I am looking for when I travel. I managed to get it down to my longing for the wilderness, to leave humankind behind me, and experience the incomprehensible that makes something great. Two articles have really helped me reflect and explore these thoughts: The Great Offline and The end of travel. For this post I will share my thoughts of travelling in Canada.\nAs a disclaimer, travelling is such a uniquely personal experience which people can shape and form to seek their love for the world. The previous articles linked feel like criticisms in the ways people travel. In a liberal society people’s norms and values come from their own search. This freedom is a curse and a blessing. It’s curse as it creates a certain emptiness where you have little to fall back on during life’s constant dilemmas. As these values are often tied to each other’s identity, they can become fanatical and polarising as we see in contemporary’s politics. In this post I try to explore these questions in our uncertain times for myself and only myself. However, the blessing is that this freedom allows us to do things differently, much faster than before. Ideas are able to exist and influence next to each other. It allows the person to figure out what they want. I want to acknowledge the many different ways of travel and this post merely tries to help me in shaping my way."

Otherwise all vacations will slowly move to a Disneyland experience: manufactured enjoyment, queues, and hordes of people everywhere. And I felt this battle while in the Canadian Rockies, as everything becomes more accessible with car thus great viewpoints and hikes were full of people. In a way some experiences felt diminished. You enter a full parking lot, while you hear familiar European languages all around you, and you keep going from place to place because now everything is accessible. Yet, I was there doing the exact same thing everyone else was doing.\nYet it is precisely accessibility what created my love for the outdoors. As a child, the Netherlands was all I was accustomed to. Born and raised where everything was safe and well-maintained. A large grass field with trees was the closest I have been to nature. That all changed when I travelled to China for the first time. My perception of the world and how everything worked changed. A big part of it was that my family became bigger. I am sure I had been told that I had more family members but it is only when you are constantly surrounded by them, you feel that you have more family members. Not even extended ones but I suddenly had a brother and a sister. They had stayed behind due to immigration issues.\n\nMost-likely connected in some deep psychological way I do not understand, the other big change was to experience the outdoors. My mom grew up in the mountains, hikes were not a way to get out of the city but rather needed to get to the essential services provided by the city. My granddad and dad used to cut trees up in the mountains, transport them down the self-made trails to make houses. While much of the standard of living had vastly improved since their youth (my siblings even had technology far more advanced than me: the laptop!), there was still an essence of it all around their birthplace. The feeling of home. However, I felt the outdoors call me the most the most when visiting the Baichuan Waterfall. Three waterfalls ranging from 200 meters to 12 meters on a simple and very accessible path, even a child could walk it, was the most spectacular thing I had seen. I got into such a high (or I drank some sacred mountain water) I had an outburst of energy going up and down the trail when we went back. This was the first time I fell in love with nature.\n\n20 years later, the exact opposite gave me this ecstasy. The first few days in the Rockies we spent on this muddy, mosquito-infested, and sketchy river crossings backpacking trip in Tonquin Valley. This entire trail at most might have 30 people on them on a day, dropping more and more the farther you go, with only grizzlies, black bears, marmots, and caribou making up the rest of this population in this stunning hike. Because of the hard path, it felt like we earnt the beautiful views of the Ramparts and Amthyst Lake. The lake’s glacier cold water felt like a relief and a burst of energy just when we needed it. What was even better, there was nobody on our camp grounds at Surprise Point. If it hadn’t been for the mosquitoes I could have stayed there the entire trip. And be in bliss. Obviously a lot has changed from now and when I had my first waterfall experience, I have changed. But to truly let go of all of society’s expectations and chaos, it seems like I should go back to a time when I wasn’t burdened with this. That period can only be found in childhood. Where I was truly myself. Exclusivity was not necessary to enjoy the outdoors when I was a child, why is it now?\n\nI suspected that one of the reasons I was so disconcerted by the narcissistic atmosphere of the selfie age was that it had exposed the solipsism of my own quest. For while I balked at ‘influencer’ superficiality, I also appreciated that my travel writing was just a more sophisticated version of the same tendency. I wondered how many other people might have been using travel in a similar, medicinal way – to curate a narrative, sometimes at the expense of subjective joy. - Henry Wismayer in The end of travel\n\nHenry Wismayer’s faced the same challenge when the theatre of travel changed. With everything becoming more accessible and cheap almost everything becomes Disneyland. You do not need to know the local language, neither do you need anything else except for your smartphone, internet, and money to get around. It feels too easy, therefore, it does not feel like I earn to be there. Instead of being grateful for the hard work of the national and provincial parks offering everyone the same opportunity to become more connected to nature my ego got in the way. Yet, in this piece I found some solace. To deeper understand my wants and needs when travelling but also when I am not. I cut down the dichotomy of travelling and non-travelling experiences.\nMy reasoning being that if I can capture the joys and wonder of my travels in everyday life, I have a lot more to enjoy. With this, I erase the pressure of wanderlust on my travels. This narcissistic view of travelling I have shaped comes from discontentment of the standard routine in my everyday life. I work, I play, I sleep. You appreciate the things you do not have when touring the unknown but it also creates a vivid contrast to your day-to-day life, making it that much more exciting. But who is to say these experiences cannot be had in your day to day life? These two experiences I have had on my travels were of mnemonic quality, mostly because they are new, they create a longer and lasting imprint in the brain. I had them before in everyday life but I was not seeking for them. This is a more conscious shift in mindset.\nA concrete step I want to take is to write more about the beautiful city I feel at home in: Rotterdam. By documenting and taking pictures of the interesting places and events of this city I can create new experiences for myself without bringing the burden that I have to do unique things across the world. I can do them right at home."

    "text": "History\nIn another time, exclusivity meant something else. The wilderness I explored in Canada was created by European settlers marking down these territories as theirs. In The Great Offline the concept of wilderness is often used to escape our shared responsibility and its history. This concept is used to hide certain narratives which are important for the betterment of the person and land. This has been far from my intended goal but I can see why it is dangerous. By looking at it from a systematic point of view, the lack of consciousness diminishes willpower and the quality of policies for fair use of the wild.\nKnowing history and culture of places outside my known world is why I travel. My cultural trip entering the world of Al-Andalus with its mosque-cathedral of Córdoba and the Alhambra reminded me that my Eurocentric view of history diminishes and neglects important pieces of history. How could we call the period between 500-1500 the dark ages in Europe? When Córdoba became the leading cultural and economic centre exploding in innovations and cultural exchange due to the relative oasis of religious tolerance of the three major religions living together. The Great Offline has reminded me that my interests can extend further to become actionable as well. I have been on the look for more, not only to challenge the Eurocentric view of history but to find narratives I can use and apply in modern day life. Here are the small pieces I learnt in Canada.\n\nWhen Jasper Park Forest Reserve was created in 1907, later officially designated as Jasper National Park with the passing of the National Park Act in 1930, the natural landscape was initially understood as a backdrop for European settler recreation. Indigenous peoples were seen as obstacles to the enjoyment of nature. According to wilderness conservation policies at the time, Indigenous peoples were considered incompatible with nature and so couldn’t live in, hunt, or harvest within park boundaries. - Parks Canada Jasper National Park\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe parks I have visited only exist as the First Nations and Métis were forcibly removed during their creation. Not only did they lose their land, they lost their way of living. The way Canada put in policies to assimilate the Indigenous people of these lands were shocking. They were a constant reminder of my privilege travelling these touristic vistas which should have been their lands for living, food, and gatherings.\nMy enjoyment of these glorious mountains were possible because the early European explorers “protected” this area. Erasing the lives and history of what came before. One big artefact of this is the way the places are named, often by colonists naming places after themself, children, pets, and employees.\n\nMore often than not, places were named according to the whims of surveyors, cartographers, and politicians of the day. This is in stark contrast to the deeply meaningful, personal, and often spiritual naming practices of Indigenous peoples. - Reclaiming Indigenous Place Names\n\nA small way for me to remember the heritage of Indigenous people is to find and add the names used by First Nations in my climbing post. As a constant reminder of this event. I would like to thank the sporadic sources providing these Indigenous names1. However, I lacked a structural way to find the corresponding names, showcasing that the revitalization of these lands is very much starting. But this is not something that has happened a 100 years ago. The hurt and damages caused by these events can only be expressed in lifetimes. Canada is still dealing with the effects of harmful colonialism.\nOn my trip the Pope made an official apology on Canadian soil for the (sexual) abuse of Indigenous children in Catholic-run schools. From 1800s to the 1990s the Canadian government sent Indigenous children to government-sponsored schools to assimilate them into Euro-Canadian culture. The last one closed in 1996. An estimated 150,000 children were removed from their homes, separated from their siblings, and stripped off their culture. They would spend half a day at school and the other half working. The Pope, however, has yet to apologize for the Doctrine of Discovery2.\n\n“The discovery doctrine, also called doctrine of discovery, is a concept of public international law that was promulgated by the Catholic Church and European monarchies in order to legitimize the colonization and evangelization of lands outside Europe.” - Wikipedia\n\nThe Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 2015 reported that at least 3200 children have died in these schools. In May 2021, the Tk’emlúps te Secwépemc First Nation used ground-penetrating radar technology at one residential school in Kamloops to discover the remains of 215 children. The reported number was only 50 in 2015. The suspected number of dead children are way higher, in the multitude of thousands.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“They washed away practically everything from our minds, all the things an Indian needed to help himself, to think the way a human person should in order to survive.” - (John Tootoosis, former student at Delmas school)\n\nA common tactic seems to be targeting minorities especially when they are doing well, setting them back for generations again. The Peasant Farm Policy restricted the First Nations ability to participate in this “new” world. As they were performing quite well in agriculture due to their inherent knowledge of the lands, policies were created to restrict their types of tools, how much they grew and could sell. The policymakers applied Darwinism to argue that the Indigenous people were not evolved enough for contemporary methods of farming.\nI was not only exposed to the policies against the Indigenous but also against the Chinese, such as the Chinese Head Tax between 1885 and 1923. As you have to pay more based on your ethnicity. It was Canada’s first legislation to exclude immigration on the basis of ethnic background. It got replaced with the Chinese Immigration Act in 1923 banning Chinese immigration and scattering families across the globe. This does not even include the harassment and rampant discriminations3 towards Chinese-owned businesses, as British Colombia passes laws restricting Chinese wholesalers, farmers, and storekeepers by restricting services regulating quantities and prices. With numerous attempts to limit businesses owned by non-whites claiming “White Canada Forever”4.\n\nAll across Canada, starting in the 1890s, cities and larger towns began to develop their own Chinatown districts. These areas were safe places for Chinese people to live, to find Chinese goods, and to meet socially. People who wanted to harass the Chinese would be less likely to do so when many Chinese people lived and worked close by and could fight back. Chinatowns often emerged in older, poorer parts of town which were less desirable. - History of Canada’s early Chinese immigrants\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Heathen Chinese\n\n\nNowadays, the policies against the Indigenous and the Chinese have resulted in an interesting mix in the big cities of Canada. I very vividly remember the first time I was getting food in Chinatown in Edmonton. Expecting Asian restaurants and well, a feeling of familiarity, I was completely unprepared for what I have seen. This view will stay with me for a long time: rows and rows of tents of the houseless on the streets with multiple people sleeping on the pavements of the parking lot of the shiny Rogers Place (stadium costing $604.5 million). It brought a feeling of unease to see the wealth disparity this clearly in front of me. The same situation uncovered in Vancouver, while I did not take a picture as I felt intrusive - I am sad I am unable to share this vivid image with everyone. A search on the internet might provide some context but I do not believe it truly captures what is happening in these cities. Chinatowns attract the houseless as these areas are often less developed, whereas the Indigenous people have lost their culture and families becoming houseless. While I can only speak for Edmonton and Vancouver, they are a stark reminder of big city problems. Ones I can work on.\n\nWhile Indigenous people account for 4.3 percent of the population, they represent between 28 and 34 percent of the homeless shelter population - Homelessness in Canada\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, unlike The Great Offline I don’t believe this is the responsibility of everyone. For example, I am very limited in what I can do in Canada but fortunately I have decided to go to work in the Dutch public sector where I can apply these lessons. While I agree with the premise of The Great Offline, as we should strive for a view in which wilderness isn’t one where its void of humanity but rather allow the possibility of sustainable cohabitation. This perspective is one filled with more optimism than the one I held. Yet I disagree on a personal level, shirking responsibility applies to all forms of escapisms, and if I may, it sucks to burden people in their escapist pleasure. Everyone has their own way of helping and dealing with the world. People should have this freedom. Does this mean they can be respectless or ignorant towards the land they use? No. But it should not feel like the burden is solely on the thrill-seeking mountaineer who wants to venture into the wilderness. We all have our vices."

    "text": "The End\nIn this post I shared my thoughts on exclusivity and mass tourism, while also diving into the history and accountability of these places I have visited. While writing this article I had a fun serendipitous moment in the train from Amsterdam to Rotterdam where a group of people discussed religion and morality. It reminded me that our moral compass in history has shifted a lot over the centuries and will continue to do so. While we lacked tolerance towards different religions, ethnicities, sex, and sexuality we have progressed a lot (this sentence comes with a disclaimer based on location, age, social group, and also recognizes the progress that can be made more). Even as these attitudes and policies have created artefacts and hurt visible now and for generations to come. We seem to be standing and working in other areas where we are actively expanding our moral compass again. To give rights to the voiceless. The way we treat animals, nature, future generations, to name a few, will also make us think how we travel and enjoy our vices. We still live in uncertain times, some might even call it the precipice, and one way to go through it is by acknowledging this ambiguity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCertain topics of travel remain undiscussed. I have yet to finalize my thoughts on the contradictions of harmful travelling to enjoy our beautiful world, while my whole presence of being there (in)directly harms the land. I flew to Canada, I drove a car in Canada. I don’t think I felt comfortable doing this but feeling locked into this system, I don’t think I would be happy either not going. But this is it for now, I feel like I will write more about the other things I have seen in Canada when I can create a coherent story out of them. The only thing you really need to know is that you must visit a Ramen Danbo.\nI enjoyed writing this blog post and using my travel journal to collect memories of these moments, it has made me a more conscious traveller. I have remembered way more than my usual trips. These posts were written by a very jetlagged person, who also decided to run a half marathon two days after he came back to get even more tired. Hopefully it still is coherent. Thank you for reading and have fun!"

Approximately three months after I came back. What have I learnt? And what stayed the same?\n\nI am writing this at a phase where I feel tired every day. Physically and mentally. The anxiety that I have that this is another burn-out makes it even worse. While I feel proud of what I have done, I can’t stop thinking if it wasn’t too much? When is enough enough? When can I stop? I don’t know. My mind does not seem to have a stop button. I need to think about it more. I am juggling three assignments at work. And I do this? Even though I have time for myself, it does not seem enough. But what is the alternative? Doing nothing? Can I also stop daydreaming that I am better? Why do I feel the need to be good. I am happy with myself but there is some part of my mind that disagrees. I remember having these thoughts during the worst periods of my thesis. I managed to go through them but I didn’t solve the underlying issue apparently. Solving. That is fun. Like it can be solved? What if I think differently, what if I transform these thoughts into something that will help me. I have to step off the treadmill and do things I want to do. Look for what makes things fun. Mr. Nobody lessons.\n\n\nObstakels in mijn leven.\nHier heb ik een video van Tommy Caldwell die voor het eerst de Dawn Wall heeft beklommen in Yosemite. Ik las de opdracht en besloot deze video te sturen omdat mijn hoofd nog in de bergen zit. Ik had een verhaal voorbereid over de mentale angst die je bij het klimmen krijgt maar dat je soms moet leren vallen om verder te gaan.\nMaar toen ging ik verder denken over obstakels in het leven en wil ik een andere richting aan deze video geven. Want ik stond heel lang niet stil bij de obstakels die ik heb gehad, als kind sta je er ook niet heel lang bij stil. In principe had ik dezelfde struggles als de meeste andere biculturele mensen in de arbeidersklasse: gebrekkig taalgebruik in de familie, alleen basisschool-educatie ouders, en de consequenties van armoede. Maar toch door geluk en mijn omgeving de sociale ladder beklommen. Het is best wel recent dat ik eigenlijk hierop trots ben geworden, want het voelde heel erg dat het gewoon normaal was. Iedereen verwachtte het ook. Het werd zelfs zo erg dat ik mijn ouders niet eens had verteld dat ik cum laude was geslaagd en dat ze het te horen kregen van een studiegenoot die me tijdens de uitreiking feliciteerden. Toen moest ik ook nog uitleggen wat het was.\nGoed, toen ik dit realiseerde had ik tegen mezelf ook gezegd dat ik eigenlijk totaal niet aan die verwachtingen wil doen. Ben daarom maar expliciet dingen gaan doen die me uit mijn comfort zone brengen, zoals door mijn sociale angst te overkomen door een bestuursjaar te doen, of mijn zwemdiploma dit jaar te halen, of helemaal alleen naar een trouwfeest te gaan, of gedisciplineerd te gaan hardlopen, of al mijn traineeopdrachten.\nMaar goed, dit video laat wel zien hoe het oncomfortabele voelt. Het is moeilijk, angstig en frustrerend maar het voelt ook heel goed als het goed gaat. Zit nu wel in een fase waarbij ik het liever wel rustiger aan wil doen, maar dat voelt wel weer saai."

I have gone through a phase of my life which sucked a lot. And what better to do after such an awful period than to memoralize it in writing.\n\nLife is not always fair. Everyone knows this, and yet for some reason we pretend to be oblivious to it. There is not a single person without a challenge in their life. A lot of people want the past to be the past but it can reveal so much. You only need to take the time to explore in the darkness. Let me guide you through my past and current challenges.\n\nHave you ever won prestigious acclaims by your school peers such as “Most-likely to do well in 20 years”? Not to brag but I have 🙃. I never understood why though. Can I even take it as a compliment? Because most of the time they would envision an office job crunching away behind my desktop computer. That’s it. Didn’t matter for what. I would do it, apparently. And it is hard to disagree with my peers, if you don’t know what to do, others will fill the gap for you.\n\nI am a nomad. Back in my childhood, I moved from Dordrecht to the Hague. From the Hague to Schiedam. We had a few stays in Vlaardingen and Tilburg (EFTELING!). A few years of carnival in Roosendaal before finally settling in the multicultural city of Rotterdam. The place that feels like home and has been my home since then.\n\nWhat do I feel proud of? It’s very difficult to feel a sense of achievement when you are a perfectionist. When you know it could be better. So in the end, you ultimately don’t really feel proud of anything. I remember achieving cum laude for my studies - but I only felt relief that I had finished. It didn’t really matter. My mom came along for my graduation and then it suddenly hit me. I didn’t even tell her. She found out after another friend congraluated me for it. Even then, I still had to explain what it is.\n\nMy parents immigrated here and worked hard to provide a good life for our family. In many ways they succeeded, we have gotten opportunities which wouldn’t be possible otherwise. In other ways, it was difficult. Language was a big obstacle to integrating into Dutch society. They had trouble understanding the education system let alone help me with my homework. Before the internet, how else would I know about the meaning of certain Dutch expressions? Most asked their parents but I couldn’t.\nSOMEONE WHO IS LOST.\n\nNeed Our life is never as perfect as we want it to be.\n\n\n\nSOMEONE WHO NEEDS A PURPOSE\n\nGo\n\nSOMEONE WHO TAKES THE CALL OF ADVENTURE\n\nSearch\nFind\nTake\nReturn\nChange\n\n\n2.

At first glance the allure seems obvious: the physicality, the rush of accomplishment, and the tight-knit community all play their part. What more do you need? Yet, one aspect often goes unnoticed when discussing its attraction: personal growth.\nAs you embark on the climbing journey, you won’t notice it at the beginning, but a seed is planted within you. It takes root and begins to grow, evolving from a mere seedling to a mighty tree through nurturing and practice. It is the mentality you bring to life. Climbing continually pushes you beyond your limits, challenges you at every turn, and forces you out of your comfort zone. It presents you with new obstacles to overcome and conquer. What is it if not an anology for life?\nIf you read this, you probably know me. I like to think, grow, and reflect. Let me give you a window into my world through the vessel that is climbing.\n\nChallenges\n\n\nThe Comfort Zone\n\n\nObstacles"

    "text": "By going into nature, I am trying to get away from civilization and its problems. However, it is naive for me to think that these experiences have not been influenced by humankind. I acknowledge that these lands were inhabited by the indigenous people of Canada who were forcibly removed and their history on the lands erased. The areas I have visited are home to many diverse groups of Indigenous peoples who have shared their land under Treaty 6, 7, 8 and the treaties of British Columbia. I honour and acknowledge all of the First Nations, Métis and Inuit peoples who have lived, travelled and gathered on these lands for thousands of years. And still do. As a reminder I have tried to add the indigenous names to these wonderful places1. In another post I explore this complex story further.\n\n\nThe name “Canada” likely comes from the word “kanata,” meaning “village” or “settlement.” In 1535, two indigenous youths told French explorer Jacques Cartier about the route to kanata; they were actually referring to the village of Stadacona, the site of the present-day City of Québec.2\n\n\nMountains, wildlife, turqoise lakes, and beautiful crags is what I had been patiently waiting for since booking my tickets to Edmonton. I was getting more and more excited to head up to the world famous Canadian Rockies. Saturday the 16th of July is when we took a small Communauto packed with camping and climbing gear to go for a 13-day adventure totalling 2354 kilometres. Like a typical romcom cliche, it was love on first sight catching my first glimpse of the mountains from Hinton. Upon arrival it is clear why they are so renowned, you notice a certain wonder in the never-ending mountain chain. However, it is only when you get inside the mountain range that you understand its greatness. The Icefields Parkway from Jasper to Banff is a drive of a lifetime. We then continued west through Yoho National Park, Revelstoke, and Whistler taking Highway 99 to the world-class climbing area of Squamish. Finally ending up in Vancouver to go back to the Netherlands. In this post I will share my climbing experiences with you in these areas.\nEverywhere you look, there are these beautiful mountains towering over you. There is a certain greatness to them not only in their aesthetic beauty but also a sheer reminder of the forces of Nature. When entering the domain of the mountains, as you look at them, you can only feel small compared to these giants. Yet, there you are going through them one by one. They evoke the sublime, “of greater mysteries and potential beyond the typical”.\nMost of the climbing here was only possible because of my good friend Jason who hosted and guided me in these wonderful places!\n Gorgeous, gorgeous mountains"

    "text": "After spending time this year in Andalusia exploring the gorgeous mountains, learning about the historic period of Al-Andalus, and admiring beautiful architectural wonders it made me wonder what exactly it is I am looking for when I travel. I managed to get it down to my longing for the wilderness, to leave humankind behind me, and experience the incomprehensible that makes something great. Two articles have really helped me reflect and explore these thoughts: The Great Offline and The end of travel. For this post I will share my thoughts of travelling in Canada.\nAs a disclaimer, travelling is such a uniquely personal experience which people can shape and form to seek their love for the world. The previous articles linked feel like criticisms in the ways people travel. In a liberal society people’s norms and values come from their own search. This freedom is a curse and a blessing. It’s curse as it creates a certain emptiness where you have little to fall back on during life’s constant dilemmas. As these values are often tied to each other’s identity, they can become fanatical and polarising as we see in contemporary’s politics. In this post I try to explore these questions in our uncertain times for myself and only myself. However, the blessing is that this freedom allows us to do things differently, much faster than before. Ideas are able to exist and influence next to each other. It allows the person to figure out what they want. I want to acknowledge the many different ways of travel and this post merely tries to help me in shaping my way."

    "title": "Travelling Nowadays",
    "section": "Exclusivity",
    "text": "Exclusivity\nIsn’t it weird? I want people to leave astounding places of nature alone so a small group of privileged people are able to have these amazing activities in the wild. Otherwise all vacations will slowly move to a Disneyland experience: manufactured enjoyment, queues, and hordes of people everywhere. And I felt this battle while in the Canadian Rockies, as everything becomes more accessible with car thus great viewpoints and hikes were full of people. In a way some experiences felt diminished. You enter a full parking lot, while you hear familiar European languages all around you, and you keep going from place to place because now everything is accessible. Yet, I was there doing the exact same thing everyone else was doing.\nYet it is precisely accessibility what created my love for the outdoors. As a child, the Netherlands was all I was accustomed to. Born and raised where everything was safe and well-maintained. A large grass field with trees was the closest I have been to nature. That all changed when I travelled to China for the first time. My perception of the world and how everything worked changed. A big part of it was that my family became bigger. I am sure I had been told that I had more family members but it is only when you are constantly surrounded by them, you feel that you have more family members. Not even extended ones but I suddenly had a brother and a sister. They had stayed behind due to immigration issues.\n\nMost-likely connected in some deep psychological way I do not understand, the other big change was to experience the outdoors. My mom grew up in the mountains, hikes were not a way to get out of the city but rather needed to get to the essential services provided by the city. My granddad and dad used to cut trees up in the mountains, transport them down the self-made trails to make houses. While much of the standard of living had vastly improved since their youth (my siblings even had technology far more advanced than me: the laptop!), there was still an essence of it all around their birthplace. The feeling of home. However, I felt the outdoors call me the most the most when visiting the Baichuan Waterfall. Three waterfalls ranging from 200 meters to 12 meters on a simple and very accessible path, even a child could walk it, was the most spectacular thing I had seen. I got into such a high (or I drank some sacred mountain water) I had an outburst of energy going up and down the trail when we went back. This was the first time I fell in love with nature.\n\n20 years later, the exact opposite gave me this ecstasy. The first few days in the Rockies we spent on this muddy, mosquito-infested, and sketchy river crossings backpacking trip in Tonquin Valley. This entire trail at most might have 30 people on them on a day, dropping more and more the farther you go, with only grizzlies, black bears, marmots, and caribou making up the rest of this population in this stunning hike. Because of the hard path, it felt like we earnt the beautiful views of the Ramparts and Amthyst Lake. The lake’s glacier cold water felt like a relief and a burst of energy just when we needed it. What was even better, there was nobody on our camp grounds at Surprise Point. If it hadn’t been for the mosquitoes I could have stayed there the entire trip. And be in bliss. Obviously a lot has changed from now and when I had my first waterfall experience, I have changed. But to truly let go of all of society’s expectations and chaos, it seems like I should go back to a time when I wasn’t burdened with this. That period can only be found in childhood. Where I was truly myself. Exclusivity was not necessary to enjoy the outdoors when I was a child, why is it now?\n\nI suspected that one of the reasons I was so disconcerted by the narcissistic atmosphere of the selfie age was that it had exposed the solipsism of my own quest. For while I balked at ‘influencer’ superficiality, I also appreciated that my travel writing was just a more sophisticated version of the same tendency. I wondered how many other people might have been using travel in a similar, medicinal way – to curate a narrative, sometimes at the expense of subjective joy. - Henry Wismayer in The end of travel\n\nHenry Wismayer’s faced the same challenge when the theatre of travel changed. With everything becoming more accessible and cheap almost everything becomes Disneyland. You do not need to know the local language, neither do you need anything else except for your smartphone, internet, and money to get around. It feels too easy, therefore, it does not feel like I earn to be there. Instead of being grateful for the hard work of the national and provincial parks offering everyone the same opportunity to become more connected to nature my ego got in the way. Yet, in this piece I found some solace. To deeper understand my wants and needs when travelling but also when I am not. I cut down the dichotomy of travelling and non-travelling experiences.\nMy reasoning being that if I can capture the joys and wonder of my travels in everyday life, I have a lot more to enjoy. With this, I erase the pressure of wanderlust on my travels. This narcissistic view of travelling I have shaped comes from discontentment of the standard routine in my everyday life. I work, I play, I sleep. You appreciate the things you do not have when touring the unknown but it also creates a vivid contrast to your day-to-day life, making it that much more exciting. But who is to say these experiences cannot be had in your day to day life? These two experiences I have had on my travels were of mnemonic quality, mostly because they are new, they create a longer and lasting imprint in the brain. I had them before in everyday life but I was not seeking for them. This is a more conscious shift in mindset.\nA concrete step I want to take is to write more about the beautiful city I feel at home in: Rotterdam. By documenting and taking pictures of the interesting places and events of this city I can create new experiences for myself without bringing the burden that I have to do unique things across the world. I can do them right at home."

    "section": "History",
    "text": "History\nIn another time, exclusivity meant something else. The wilderness I explored in Canada was created by European settlers marking down these territories as theirs. In The Great Offline the concept of wilderness is often used to escape our shared responsibility and its history. This concept is used to hide certain narratives which are important for the betterment of the person and land. This has been far from my intended goal but I can see why it is dangerous. By looking at it from a systematic point of view, the lack of consciousness diminishes willpower and the quality of policies for fair use of the wild.\nKnowing history and culture of places outside my known world is why I travel. My cultural trip entering the world of Al-Andalus with its mosque-cathedral of Córdoba and the Alhambra reminded me that my Eurocentric view of history diminishes and neglects important pieces of history. How could we call the period between 500-1500 the dark ages in Europe? When Córdoba became the leading cultural and economic centre exploding in innovations and cultural exchange due to the relative oasis of religious tolerance of the three major religions living together. The Great Offline has reminded me that my interests can extend further to become actionable as well. I have been on the look for more, not only to challenge the Eurocentric view of history but to find narratives I can use and apply in modern day life. Here are the small pieces I learnt in Canada.\n\nWhen Jasper Park Forest Reserve was created in 1907, later officially designated as Jasper National Park with the passing of the National Park Act in 1930, the natural landscape was initially understood as a backdrop for European settler recreation. Indigenous peoples were seen as obstacles to the enjoyment of nature. According to wilderness conservation policies at the time, Indigenous peoples were considered incompatible with nature and so couldn’t live in, hunt, or harvest within park boundaries. - Parks Canada Jasper National Park\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe parks I have visited only exist as the First Nations and Métis were forcibly removed during their creation. Not only did they lose their land, they lost their way of living. The way Canada put in policies to assimilate the Indigenous people of these lands were shocking. They were a constant reminder of my privilege travelling these touristic vistas which should have been their lands for living, food, and gatherings.\nMy enjoyment of these glorious mountains were possible because the early European explorers “protected” this area. Erasing the lives and history of what came before. One big artefact of this is the way the places are named, often by colonists naming places after themself, children, pets, and employees.\n\nMore often than not, places were named according to the whims of surveyors, cartographers, and politicians of the day. This is in stark contrast to the deeply meaningful, personal, and often spiritual naming practices of Indigenous peoples. - Reclaiming Indigenous Place Names\n\nA small way for me to remember the heritage of Indigenous people is to find and add the names used by First Nations in my climbing post. As a constant reminder of this event. I would like to thank the sporadic sources providing these Indigenous names1. However, I lacked a structural way to find the corresponding names, showcasing that the revitalization of these lands is very much starting. But this is not something that has happened a 100 years ago. The hurt and damages caused by these events can only be expressed in lifetimes. Canada is still dealing with the effects of harmful colonialism.\nOn my trip the Pope made an official apology on Canadian soil for the (sexual) abuse of Indigenous children in Catholic-run schools. From 1800s to the 1990s the Canadian government sent Indigenous children to government-sponsored schools to assimilate them into Euro-Canadian culture. The last one closed in 1996. An estimated 150,000 children were removed from their homes, separated from their siblings, and stripped off their culture. They would spend half a day at school and the other half working. The Pope, however, has yet to apologize for the Doctrine of Discovery2.\n\n“The discovery doctrine, also called doctrine of discovery, is a concept of public international law that was promulgated by the Catholic Church and European monarchies in order to legitimize the colonization and evangelization of lands outside Europe.” - Wikipedia\n\nThe Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 2015 reported that at least 3200 children have died in these schools. In May 2021, the Tk’emlúps te Secwépemc First Nation used ground-penetrating radar technology at one residential school in Kamloops to discover the remains of 215 children. The reported number was only 50 in 2015. The suspected number of dead children are way higher, in the multitude of thousands.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“They washed away practically everything from our minds, all the things an Indian needed to help himself, to think the way a human person should in order to survive.” - (John Tootoosis, former student at Delmas school)\n\nA common tactic seems to be targeting minorities especially when they are doing well, setting them back for generations again. The Peasant Farm Policy restricted the First Nations ability to participate in this “new” world. As they were performing quite well in agriculture due to their inherent knowledge of the lands, policies were created to restrict their types of tools, how much they grew and could sell. The policymakers applied Darwinism to argue that the Indigenous people were not evolved enough for contemporary methods of farming.\nI was not only exposed to the policies against the Indigenous but also against the Chinese, such as the Chinese Head Tax between 1885 and 1923. As you have to pay more based on your ethnicity. It was Canada’s first legislation to exclude immigration on the basis of ethnic background. It got replaced with the Chinese Immigration Act in 1923 banning Chinese immigration and scattering families across the globe. This does not even include the harassment and rampant discriminations3 towards Chinese-owned businesses, as British Colombia passes laws restricting Chinese wholesalers, farmers, and storekeepers by restricting services regulating quantities and prices. With numerous attempts to limit businesses owned by non-whites claiming “White Canada Forever”4.\n\nAll across Canada, starting in the 1890s, cities and larger towns began to develop their own Chinatown districts. These areas were safe places for Chinese people to live, to find Chinese goods, and to meet socially. People who wanted to harass the Chinese would be less likely to do so when many Chinese people lived and worked close by and could fight back. Chinatowns often emerged in older, poorer parts of town which were less desirable. - History of Canada’s early Chinese immigrants\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Heathen Chinese\n\n\nNowadays, the policies against the Indigenous and the Chinese have resulted in an interesting mix in the big cities of Canada. I very vividly remember the first time I was getting food in Chinatown in Edmonton. Expecting Asian restaurants and well, a feeling of familiarity, I was completely unprepared for what I have seen. This view will stay with me for a long time: rows and rows of tents of the houseless on the streets with multiple people sleeping on the pavements of the parking lot of the shiny Rogers Place (stadium costing $604.5 million). It brought a feeling of unease to see the wealth disparity this clearly in front of me. The same situation uncovered in Vancouver, while I did not take a picture as I felt intrusive - I am sad I am unable to share this vivid image with everyone. A search on the internet might provide some context but I do not believe it truly captures what is happening in these cities. Chinatowns attract the houseless as these areas are often less developed, whereas the Indigenous people have lost their culture and families becoming houseless. While I can only speak for Edmonton and Vancouver, they are a stark reminder of big city problems. Ones I can work on.\n\nWhile Indigenous people account for 4.3 percent of the population, they represent between 28 and 34 percent of the homeless shelter population - Homelessness in Canada\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, unlike The Great Offline I don’t believe this is the responsibility of everyone. For example, I am very limited in what I can do in Canada but fortunately I have decided to go to work in the Dutch public sector where I can apply these lessons. While I agree with the premise of The Great Offline, as we should strive for a view in which wilderness isn’t one where its void of humanity but rather allow the possibility of sustainable cohabitation. This perspective is one filled with more optimism than the one I held. Yet I disagree on a personal level, shirking responsibility applies to all forms of escapisms, and if I may, it sucks to burden people in their escapist pleasure. Everyone has their own way of helping and dealing with the world. People should have this freedom. Does this mean they can be respectless or ignorant towards the land they use? No. But it should not feel like the burden is solely on the thrill-seeking mountaineer who wants to venture into the wilderness. We all have our vices."

    "text": "The End\nIn this post I shared my thoughts on exclusivity and mass tourism, while also diving into the history and accountability of these places I have visited. While writing this article I had a fun serendipitous moment in the train from Amsterdam to Rotterdam where a group of people discussed religion and morality. It reminded me that our moral compass in history has shifted a lot over the centuries and will continue to do so. While we lacked tolerance towards different religions, ethnicities, sex, and sexuality we have progressed a lot (this sentence comes with a disclaimer based on location, age, social group, and also recognizes the progress that can be made more). Even as these attitudes and policies have created artefacts and hurt visible now and for generations to come. We seem to be standing and working in other areas where we are actively expanding our moral compass again. To give rights to the voiceless. The way we treat animals, nature, future generations, to name a few, will also make us think how we travel and enjoy our vices. We still live in uncertain times, some might even call it the precipice, and one way to go through it is by acknowledging this ambiguity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCertain topics of travel remain undiscussed. I have yet to finalize my thoughts on the contradictions of harmful travelling to enjoy our beautiful world, while my whole presence of being there (in)directly harms the land. I flew to Canada, I drove a car in Canada. I don’t think I felt comfortable doing this but feeling locked into this system, I don’t think I would be happy either not going. But this is it for now, I feel like I will write more about the other things I have seen in Canada when I can create a coherent story out of them. The only thing you really need to know is that you must visit a Ramen Danbo.\nI enjoyed writing this blog post and using my travel journal to collect memories of these moments, it has made me a more conscious traveller. I have remembered way more than my usual trips. These posts were written by a very jetlagged person, who also decided to run a half marathon two days after he came back to get even more tired. Hopefully it still is coherent. Thank you for reading and have fun!"

A term for when your mind can only think of the unsolvable, complex, international problems we face. Working tirelessly every day my mind was keen on distraction. There was no lack of options either: Netflix, Facebook, and YouTube all offered much-needed relaxation. Ultimately, YouTube was the more convincing offer. I would work in the Hague until 6 p.m., take the tram home and then, together with over 30 million others worldwide, watch YouTube videos to relax. After searching for “chess” and observing Magnus Carlsen pull off a wonderful win using the Sicilian defense, something peculiar happened.\nA video played, showing cheaters in the world of chess. After clicking back to a memorable game between Ajax and Real Madrid, YouTube took me towards videos on bribery. Outlandish claims became more present the further I went. The pattern continued as I searched for more topics, always leading me to more extremist videos on the topic I had initially searched for. Documentaries on the second world war led to holocaust denial videos, speeches by American presidents led to smear campaigns. YouTube’s autoplay function and the recommendation system drew my curiosity."

    "text": "The Influence of YouTube’s Recommendation Algorithm\nIt used to be that my friends would advise me what to watch, now YouTube seems to have replaced them. In return we do not need to spend any effort finding the next video that will get our minds of things. Using smart personalized suggestions, based on the enormous amount of data Alphabet Inc (owner of YouTube and Google services) owns, they know what makes you click. The recommender system keeps people interested and glued to the screen. The system recommends around 70% of the videos watched by users; the influence of YouTube is unavoidable. But why does this algorithm drive us to extremist content, with no intention from our side?\nTo answer that question, we need to inspect YouTube’s business model. As a platform, it brings together content creators and content viewers. YouTube makes money by brokering fitting advertisements to users. To optimize this process, their goal is to maximize the time spent on YouTube. This has not gone unnoticed by Reed Hastings, CEO of Netflix. During the earnings call he said: “Netflix’s biggest competitors are YouTube, Facebook, and sleep”. The attention economy views time as a scarce resource, if you spend time on one thing, it means a loss of time for something else. In the past, the market focused on getting money, nowadays, this fight is about time spent. More time on a platform means more advertisements, thus increasing YouTube’s share of the pie. This effect also takes place on YouTube itself, as they pay content creators proportional to the number of views they get on their videos, which again incentivizes to maximize the time spent by the users."

    "text": "Human Characteristics Exploited by YouTube\nTo maximize this time, YouTube makes use of different human characteristics. First, people spend time on content out of the ordinary. Think of the number of movies or books about a regular person going to his regular job every day: The Godfather does not manage a supermarket, Batman and the Joker do not run a restaurant, and Frodo does not bring back a book to the library. Deep love dramas, heavy war stories, and extreme conspiracy theories attract people. This is no different when watching a YouTube video on the couch, where clickbait titles and extremist videos are just one click away.\nWhat makes things even worse is the human nature of curiosity.

Imagine if you had to think yourself what to watch every night; indeed, you would be inclined to move on to something more convenient. In essence, corporations nowadays have fulfilled this decision of what we spent our time on for us. Though, looking at it that way, it is similar to voting for the national elections where someone has already filled in a choice for you, without explaining how they arrived at this conclusion. You could still erase that choice but convenience dictates that the majority will leave it there. Even though YouTube has “only” a facilitating role, their influence is significant to say the least. YouTube possesses the power to decide what users watch.\nUsers however, cannot get a grasp on what YouTube is actually doing to recommend videos. Since the introduction of their personalized recommendations with a deep neural network they have tweaked and changed the algorithm behind closed curtains. There is no way to know for certain what they actually did, as they will never reveal it voluntarily. It is in their best interest to find the ‘best’ algorithm to keep viewers attracted to their platform, in order to outrun competition. However, when the curtain gets lifted, it does not look good. In an interview with Bloomberg, it is stated that many engineers at YouTube claimed that the leaders were not interested in removing extremist videos or conspiracies. Yonatan Zunger, privacy engineer at the time of the introduction of the neural network algorithm, mentioned that he had a solution in place for videos close to breaching the community guidelines, allow them on the platform but do not recommend them, which was promptly rejected.

The head of Wikipedia’s public relations department, Katherine Maher, had some reservations. While Wikipedia is quite accurate, it relies on crowdsourcing and contributions of volunteers. According to Maher people need to be critical and check the sources which they simply ‘can’t do in a simple search result’, like in the case of the Parkland shooting.\nNot only Wikipedia articles will be included, but also ‘authoritative’ news will be included.

    "section": "Proposed Scheme for Improvements",
    "text": "Proposed Scheme for Improvements\nAs YouTube operates in an electronic global environment that crosses borders, it is impossible to find a one-size-fits-all solution to the negative impact the recommender systems have on society. YouTube can be seen as a natural monopoly as a video platform, which means they hold all the power. Next to that, the many values involved, such as freedom of speech, democratic sovereignty and censorship, make it hard to keep all parties happy. So instead of searching for the policy that will fix the world, we propose a scheme of improvements to the system.\nThe first part of this scheme is to bring back old friends into the recommendation system in addition to YouTube’s recommendations. Making use of the friend system in YouTube, users can recommend videos to each other, which will be automatically added to the autoplaylist of the friends selected by the sharer. When all the videos recommended by a user’s friends are watched, the system returns to its current state of using YouTube’s recommended videos. As this function will be used more over time, the time spent on YouTube will exist for a bigger part of videos recommended by friends. A big impact this will make is the effect of social norms feeding into the recommendations.\nThe solution is, however, not perfect. Firstly, it is likely that there will be ‘influencers’ with an enormous amount of friends recommending videos. Secondly, it is very easy to get stuck in filter bubbles as well, only this time together with your friends. However, there is a shift of power from YouTube back to society. Whenever you get a video recommended you know it is from someone you are familiar with instead of a corporate entity. At the same time, the business model of YouTube does not have to change a single bit, but could even result in better user satisfaction.\nThe second part of the scheme incorporates society as a whole. Kevin Roose, a columnist for Business and a writer-at-large for The New York Times, talks of “deprogramming a generation” as a necessity to change the impact of platforms like YouTube. This part focuses on giving the people the tools to examine sources critically. YouTube is not just a place to find entertainment, but as was found by Pearson Education, over 50% of youngsters reaches out to YouTube as an information source. The platform should be seen as the library of the now. It is therefore important to inform the users which of the “books” can be seen as reliable, useful and trustworthy, just like it is taught in schools for books or internet websites. This collaborative effort between the government and YouTube should start in school but also on YouTube itself. This way the minds of the users will be changed, and harmful videos will be evaded. Specifically, an informative video could be created that explains how to interact with the different kinds of videos on YouTube.\nThe third and last part of our scheme that will shrink the negative impact of YouTube is to make the platform responsible for the videos they recommend. This would mean slightly pulling YouTube out of its facilitating role, causing them to be more involved with the content displayed on their platform. A legal framework should be created indicating the responsibility of YouTube and the changes the platform should make in order to recommend only the fruitful videos to users. This responsibility would at least remove the fake news videos that have been duplicated multiple times and viewed/liked by fake subscribers. If YouTube would be responsible for the videos they recommend, these types of fake, harming videos would not have a place in the auto playlists any longer. It is important to stress that this part of the scheme does not influence the freedom of speech value, as every legal video will stay available on the platform. No censorship takes place in what can be uploaded, recommendations will only become more thoughtful."

    "section": "Conclusion",
    "text": "Conclusion\nThe scheme sketched above can be seen as the way society started to deal with cigarettes not that long ago. Friends would not recommend cigarettes to each other, due to the social norms that exist. Of course smokers would recommend them, but this is inevitable. Likewise, extremist people are always going to find their way into extremist videos, and will recommend them to their friends as well. However, adding social norms to the system will decrease the overall use of the undesirable product. The education part of the scheme can also be seen in the use of cigarettes. Parents teach their children that smoking is bad, schools teach their students the same thing. By creating an appealing video that explains the dangers of extremist videos, but also shows how to interact with them, people will learn to evade such videos. Lastly, like society stopped the promotion of cigarettes, in the future the responsible YouTube will stop promoting (recommending) extremist videos completely. The scheme is a first step in regulating the influence of YouTube on our daily lives. When the walk is continued, YouTube will be a safe environment for relaxing distraction. It will not settle all the problems that YouTube’s algorithms inhabit, but at least we will be able to watch our daily chess videos peacefully."

It simply is something I am not good at, and I have never been content with my works in the written word. It could always be a little bit better. But I decided this negative association doesn’t have to be there forever in my life. There are many positives to gain from constructing loose thoughts into concise texts. Next to it being an outlet for creativity I also want to work on how to transfer my inner mind to the outer world.

A term for when your mind can only think of the unsolvable, complex, international problems we face. Working tirelessly every day my mind was keen on distraction. There was no lack of options either: Netflix, Facebook, and YouTube all offered much-needed relaxation. Ultimately, YouTube was the more convincing offer. I would work in the Hague until 6 p.m., take the tram home and then, together with over 30 million others worldwide, watch YouTube videos to relax. After searching for “chess” and observing Magnus Carlsen pull off a wonderful win using the Sicilian defense, something peculiar happened.\nA video played, showing cheaters in the world of chess. After clicking back to a memorable game between Ajax and Real Madrid, YouTube took me towards videos on bribery. Outlandish claims became more present the further I went. The pattern continued as I searched for more topics, always leading me to more extremist videos on the topic I had initially searched for. Documentaries on the second world war led to holocaust denial videos, speeches by American presidents led to smear campaigns. YouTube’s autoplay function and the recommendation system drew my curiosity."

    "text": "The Influence of YouTube’s Recommendation Algorithm\nIt used to be that my friends would advise me what to watch, now YouTube seems to have replaced them. In return we do not need to spend any effort finding the next video that will get our minds of things. Using smart personalized suggestions, based on the enormous amount of data Alphabet Inc (owner of YouTube and Google services) owns, they know what makes you click. The recommender system keeps people interested and glued to the screen. The system recommends around 70% of the videos watched by users; the influence of YouTube is unavoidable. But why does this algorithm drive us to extremist content, with no intention from our side?\nTo answer that question, we need to inspect YouTube’s business model. As a platform, it brings together content creators and content viewers. YouTube makes money by brokering fitting advertisements to users. To optimize this process, their goal is to maximize the time spent on YouTube. This has not gone unnoticed by Reed Hastings, CEO of Netflix. During the earnings call he said: “Netflix’s biggest competitors are YouTube, Facebook, and sleep”. The attention economy views time as a scarce resource, if you spend time on one thing, it means a loss of time for something else. In the past, the market focused on getting money, nowadays, this fight is about time spent. More time on a platform means more advertisements, thus increasing YouTube’s share of the pie. This effect also takes place on YouTube itself, as they pay content creators proportional to the number of views they get on their videos, which again incentivizes to maximize the time spent by the users."

    "text": "Human Characteristics Exploited by YouTube\nTo maximize this time, YouTube makes use of different human characteristics. First, people spend time on content out of the ordinary. Think of the number of movies or books about a regular person going to his regular job every day: The Godfather does not manage a supermarket, Batman and the Joker do not run a restaurant, and Frodo does not bring back a book to the library. Deep love dramas, heavy war stories, and extreme conspiracy theories attract people. This is no different when watching a YouTube video on the couch, where clickbait titles and extremist videos are just one click away.\nWhat makes things even worse is the human nature of curiosity. YouTube speaks to our core instincts by showing the tip of the iceberg, often in the shape of an interesting-looking clickbait title.

    "text": "Proposed Scheme for Improvements\nAs YouTube operates in an electronic global environment that crosses borders, it is impossible to find a one-size-fits-all solution to the negative impact the recommender systems have on society. YouTube can be seen as a natural monopoly as a video platform, which means they hold all the power. Next to that, the many values involved, such as freedom of speech, democratic sovereignty and censorship, make it hard to keep all parties happy. So instead of searching for the policy that will fix the world, we propose a scheme of improvements to the system.\nThe first part of this scheme is to bring back old friends into the recommendation system in addition to YouTube’s recommendations. Making use of the friend system in YouTube, users can recommend videos to each other, which will be automatically added to the autoplaylist of the friends selected by the sharer. When all the videos recommended by a user’s friends are watched, the system returns to its current state of using YouTube’s recommended videos. As this function will be used more over time, the time spent on YouTube will exist for a bigger part of videos recommended by friends. A big impact this will make is the effect of social norms feeding into the recommendations.\nThe solution is, however, not perfect. Firstly, it is likely that there will be ‘influencers’ with an enormous amount of friends recommending videos. Secondly, it is very easy to get stuck in filter bubbles as well, only this time together with your friends. However, there is a shift of power from YouTube back to society. Whenever you get a video recommended you know it is from someone you are familiar with instead of a corporate entity. At the same time, the business model of YouTube does not have to change a single bit, but could even result in better user satisfaction.\nThe second part of the scheme incorporates society as a whole. Kevin Roose, a columnist for Business and a writer-at-large for The New York Times, talks of “deprogramming a generation” as a necessity to change the impact of platforms like YouTube. This part focuses on giving the people the tools to examine sources critically. YouTube is not just a place to find entertainment, but as was found by Pearson Education, over 50% of youngsters reaches out to YouTube as an information source. The platform should be seen as the library of the now. It is therefore important to inform the users which of the “books” can be seen as reliable, useful and trustworthy, just like it is taught in schools for books or internet websites. This collaborative effort between the government and YouTube should start in school but also on YouTube itself. This way the minds of the users will be changed, and harmful videos will be evaded. Specifically, an informative video could be created that explains how to interact with the different kinds of videos on YouTube.\nThe third and last part of our scheme that will shrink the negative impact of YouTube is to make the platform responsible for the videos they recommend. This would mean slightly pulling YouTube out of its facilitating role, causing them to be more involved with the content displayed on their platform. A legal framework should be created indicating the responsibility of YouTube and the changes the platform should make in order to recommend only the fruitful videos to users. This responsibility would at least remove the fake news videos that have been duplicated multiple times and viewed/liked by fake subscribers. If YouTube would be responsible for the videos they recommend, these types of fake, harming videos would not have a place in the auto playlists any longer. It is important to stress that this part of the scheme does not influence the freedom of speech value, as every legal video will stay available on the platform. No censorship takes place in what can be uploaded, recommendations will only become more thoughtful."

    "section": "Conclusion",
    "text": "Conclusion\nThe scheme sketched above can be seen as the way society started to deal with cigarettes not that long ago. Friends would not recommend cigarettes to each other, due to the social norms that exist. Of course smokers would recommend them, but this is inevitable. Likewise, extremist people are always going to find their way into extremist videos, and will recommend them to their friends as well. However, adding social norms to the system will decrease the overall use of the undesirable product. The education part of the scheme can also be seen in the use of cigarettes. Parents teach their children that smoking is bad, schools teach their students the same thing. By creating an appealing video that explains the dangers of extremist videos, but also shows how to interact with them, people will learn to evade such videos. Lastly, like society stopped the promotion of cigarettes, in the future the responsible YouTube will stop promoting (recommending) extremist videos completely. The scheme is a first step in regulating the influence of YouTube on our daily lives. When the walk is continued, YouTube will be a safe environment for relaxing distraction. It will not settle all the problems that YouTube’s algorithms inhabit, but at least we will be able to watch our daily chess videos peacefully."
